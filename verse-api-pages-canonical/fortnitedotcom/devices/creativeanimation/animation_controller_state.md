## Enumerators
The `animation_controller_state` enumeration includes the following enumerators:
Name | Description
---|---
`InvalidObject` |  The target of the animation is not an animatable prop. This could be because:
  * It is not a `creative_prop` that can be animated.
  * It was disposed or otherwise destroyed.
  * It has the 'Register with Structural Grid' option set in UEFN.

`AnimationNotSet` |  No animation has been successfully set via `animation_controller.SetAnimation`, or that animation has been cleared by a failed call to `animation_controller.SetAnimation`.
`Stopped` |  Animation has either never started, finished, or was explicitly stopped.
`Playing` |  Animation is playing.
`Paused` |  Animation is paused.
