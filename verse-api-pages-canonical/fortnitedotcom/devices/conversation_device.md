## Exposed Interfaces
This class exposes the following interfaces:
Name | Description  
---|---  
[`enableable`](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/verse-api/versedotorg/verse/enableable) |  Implemented by classes whose instances can be enabled and disabled.  
## Members
This class has both data members and functions.
### Data
Data Member Name | Type | Description  
---|---|---  
`AllowedConversationCount` | `?int` |  Sets the number of conversations allowed at once with the device. This will not make any conversations exit if there are more current conversations than allowed after this call.  
`CancelEvent` | `listenable(payload)` |  Signalled when a conversation has ended early by EndConversation or EndConversationForAll.  
`CharactersPerSecond` | `??float` |  The constant rate that characters are revealed over the course of a second when a Speech node activates. The exact characters in the respective speech node are revealed and do not combine into glyphs. When the value is changed, active conversations are not updated. Works with the Box and Custom UI. The value of CharactersPerSecond is the default value used when initiating a conversation. CharactersPerSecond will be clamped between 0.25 and 100.0. If set to false all the characters will reveal instantly.  
`EndEvent` | `listenable(payload)` |  Signalled when a conversation has ended.  
`IndicatorBubbleRange` | `?float` |  The range that the Indicator Bubble will be seen at. Clamps to range[0, 25].  
`OnConversationEvent` | `listenable(payload)` |  Signaled when a choice node tied to this event is selected by an `agent`. Sends the `agent` that triggered the event, and `EventNumber` is the number specified in the Conversation Event node.  
`ShowConversationTextInWorldSpace` | `?logic` |  Whether the device will show conversation text in worldspace when using the Radial UI type.  
`ShowIndicatorBubble` | `?logic` |  whether the device will show the Indicator Bubble when nearby.  
`ShowNameWhenNearby` | `?logic` |  Whether the device will show the Speaker when nearby.  
`SpeakerName` | `?message` |  The Speaker Name of the device. When the value is changed, active conversations are not updated. The value of SpeakerName is the default value used when initiating a conversation.
