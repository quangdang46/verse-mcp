---|---
`public` | The identifier is universally accessible. You can use this on modules, classes, interfaces, structs, enums, methods, and data.
### Effects
The following effects determine how `SetTimeBetweenSpawns` behaves in your programs. For the complete list of effects, see the Effect Specifers section of the [Specifiers Page](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/specifiers-and-attributes-in-verse).
Effect | Meaning
---|---
`transacts` | This effect indicates that any actions performed by the function can be rolled back. The transacts effect is required any time a mutable variable (`var`) is written. You’ll be notified when you compile your code if the `transacts` effect was added to a function that can’t be rolled back. Note that this check is not done for functions with the `native` specifier.
`no_rollback` | This is the default effect when no exclusive effect is specified. The `no_rollback` effect indicates that any actions performed by the function cannot be undone and so the function cannot be used in a failure context. This effect cannot be manually specified.
