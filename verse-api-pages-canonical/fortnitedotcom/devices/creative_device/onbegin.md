|   
---|---  
Verse `using` statement | `using { /Fortnite.com/Devices }`  
`OnBegin<public><native_callable>()<transacts><suspends><no_rollback>:void`
## Parameters
`OnBegin` does not take any parameters.
## Attributes, Specifiers, and Effects
### Specifiers
The following specifiers determine how you can interact with `OnBegin` in your programs. For the complete list of specifiers, see the [Specifiers Page](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/specifiers-and-attributes-in-verse).
Specifier | Meaning  
---|---  
`public` | The identifier is universally accessible. You can use this on modules, classes, interfaces, structs, enums, methods, and data.  
`native_callable` | Indicates that an instance method is both native (implemented in C++) and may be called by other C++ code. You can see this specifier used on an instance method. This specifier doesn’t propagate to subclasses and so you don’t need to add it to a definition when overriding a method that has this specifier.  
### Effects
The following effects determine how `OnBegin` behaves in your programs. For the complete list of effects, see the Effect Specifers section of the [Specifiers Page](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/specifiers-and-attributes-in-verse).
Effect | Meaning  
---|---  
`transacts` | This effect indicates that any actions performed by the function can be rolled back. The transacts effect is required any time a mutable variable (`var`) is written. You’ll be notified when you compile your code if the `transacts` effect was added to a function that can’t be rolled back. Note that this check is not done for functions with the `native` specifier.  
`suspends` | Indicates that the function is async. Creates an async context for the body of the function.  
`no_rollback` | This is the default effect when no exclusive effect is specified. The `no_rollback` effect indicates that any actions performed by the function cannot be undone and so the function cannot be used in a failure context. This effect cannot be manually specified.
