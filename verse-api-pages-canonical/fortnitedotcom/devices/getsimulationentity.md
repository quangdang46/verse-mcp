`(CreativeDevice:creative_device).GetSimulationEntity<public><native>()<transacts><decides>:`[`entity`](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/verse-api/versedotorg/scenegraph/entity)
## Parameters
`GetSimulationEntity` takes the following parameters:
Name | Type | Description  
---|---|---  
`CreativeDevice` | `creative_device` |   
## Attributes, Specifiers, and Effects
The following attributes, specifiers, and effects determine how you can interact with `GetSimulationEntity` in your programs, as well as how it behaves in your programs and UEFN. For the complete list of attributes, specifiers, and effects; see the [Specifiers Page](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/specifiers-and-attributes-in-verse).
### Specifiers
Specifier | Meaning  
---|---  
`public` | The identifier is universally accessible. You can use this on modules, classes, interfaces, structs, enums, methods, and data.  
`native` | Indicates that the definition details of the element are implemented in C++. Verse definitions with the `native` specifier auto-generate C++ definitions that a developer can then fill out its implementation. You can use this specifier on classes, interfaces, enums, methods, and data.  
### Effects
Effect | Meaning  
---|---  
`transacts` | This effect indicates that any actions performed by the function can be rolled back. The transacts effect is required any time a mutable variable (`var`) is written. You'll be notified when you compile your code if the `transacts` effect was added to a function that can't be rolled back. Note that this check is not done for functions with the `native` specifier.  
`decides` | Indicates that the function can fail, and that calling this function is a [failable expression](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/failure-in-verse#failableexpression). Function definitions with the `decides` effect must also have the `transacts` effect, which means the actions performed by this function can be rolled back (as if the actions were never performed), if there's a failure anywhere in the function.
