## Attributes, Specifiers, and Effects
The following attributes, specifiers, and effects determine how you can interact with `GetInstigator` in your programs, as well as how it behaves in your programs and UEFN. For the complete list of attributes, specifiers, and effects; see the [Specifiers Page](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/specifiers-and-attributes-in-verse).
### Specifiers
Specifier | Meaning
---|---
`public` | The identifier is universally accessible. You can use this on modules, classes, interfaces, structs, enums, methods, and data.
`native` | Indicates that the definition details of the element are implemented in C++. Verse definitions with the `native` specifier auto-generate C++ definitions that a developer can then fill out its implementation. You can use this specifier on classes, interfaces, enums, methods, and data.
### Effects
Effect | Meaning
---|---
`transacts` | This effect indicates that any actions performed by the function can be rolled back. The transacts effect is required any time a mutable variable (`var`) is written. You’ll be notified when you compile your code if the `transacts` effect was added to a function that can’t be rolled back. Note that this check is not done for functions with the `native` specifier.
