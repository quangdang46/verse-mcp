# operator'+' function
Learn technical details about the operator'+' function.
Returns a new set that is the union of all elements in `InSetL` set and `InSetR`.
|
---|---
Verse `using` statement | `using { /Verse.org/Verse }`
`operator'+'<public><native>(InSetL:classifiable_subset(element_type), InSetR:classifiable_subset(element_type) where t:any)<transacts>:`[`classifiable_subset(element_type)`](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/verse-api/versedotorg/verse/classifiable_subset/classifiable_subset\(element_type\))
## Parameters
`operator'+'` takes the following parameters:
Name | Type | Description
---|---|---
`InSetL` | `classifiable_subset(element_type)` |
`InSetR` | `classifiable_subset(element_type)` |
`t` | `any` |
## Attributes, Specifiers, and Effects
### Attributes
The following attributes determine how `operator'+'` behaves outside the Verse language. For the complete list of attributes, see the Attributes section of the [Specifiers Page](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/specifiers-and-attributes-in-verse).
Attribute | Arguments | Meaning
---|---|---
`experimental` |  | This feature is in an experimental state, and you cannot publish projects implmenting it. The API for this feature is subject to change and backward compatibility is not guaranteed.
### Specifiers
The following specifiers determine how you can interact with `operator'+'` in your programs. For the complete list of specifiers, see the [Specifiers Page](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/specifiers-and-attributes-in-verse).
Specifier | Meaning
---|---
`public` | The identifier is universally accessible. You can use this on modules, classes, interfaces, structs, enums, methods, and data.
`native` | Indicates that the definition details of the element are implemented in C++. Verse definitions with the `native` specifier auto-generate C++ definitions that a developer can then fill out its implementation. You can use this specifier on classes, interfaces, enums, methods, and data.
### Effects
The following effects determine how `operator'+'` behaves in your programs. For the complete list of effects, see the Effect Specifers section of the [Specifiers Page](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/specifiers-and-attributes-in-verse).
Effect | Meaning
---|---
`transacts` | This effect indicates that any actions performed by the function can be rolled back. The transacts effect is required any time a mutable variable (`var`) is written. You’ll be notified when you compile your code if the `transacts` effect was added to a function that can’t be rolled back. Note that this check is not done for functions with the `native` specifier.
