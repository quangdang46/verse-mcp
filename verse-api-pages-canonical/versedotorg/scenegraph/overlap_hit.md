# overlap_hit struct
Learn technical details about the overlap_hit struct.
The results of an overlap query. See entity.FindOverlapHits(). We will get one overlap_hit for each intersection of any volume in SourceVolumes with any other volume.

## Members
This struct has data members, but no functions.
### Data
Data Member Name | Type | Description
---|---|---
`SourceComponent` | `?component` |  The source component and volume (query input). For compound inputs (like an entity hierarchy) this will be a component/volume in that hierarchy. The SourceTransform is the transform of SourceVolume used for the overlap test. For single volume inputs like a sphere, the Source volume and transform are just the inputs to the overlap test, and the component is false.
`SourceVolume` | `collision_volume` |  The source volume (query input)
`SourceGlobalTransform` | `transform` |  The source volume transform
`TargetComponent` | `component` |  The component that was hit by SourceVolume
`TargetVolume` | `collision_element` |  The volume that was hit by SourceVolume
