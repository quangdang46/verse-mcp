A **Character** is a mannequin that you can use to create [NPC](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) characters that can interact with players in a game. You can tie its appearance or behavior to actions by a player or events caused by other devices.
To find the Character device, see [Using Devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-devices-in-fortnite).
##  Contextual Filtering
Some devices are affected by a feature called **contextual filtering**. This feature hides or displays options depending on the values selected for certain related options. This reduces clutter in the Customize panel and makes options easier to manage and navigate. To help identify them, values that trigger contextual filtering are in _italic_.
All options are listed, including those affected by contextual filtering; if they are hidden or displayed based on a specific option's value, there will be a note about it in the Description field for that option.
