# Supply Drop Spawner Devices
Spawn an aerial supply drop to provide players with weapons or supplies.
![Supply Drop Spawner Devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/f05fc604-4e95-4192-b0c4-9df8d38d9695?resizing_type=fill&width=1920&height=335)
A **Supply Drop Spawner** [spawns](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#spawning) a box of supplies that parachutes down from the sky. This can be triggered by players, providing a more dynamic and immersive way of equipping players with weapons and other items.
There are a lot of [game modes](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#game-mode) where this would be useful. For example:
  * If your island is a Battle Royale or Storm Wars game, you can spawn [supply drops](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) just like Fortnite Battle Royale.
  * If you have a zombie defense game, players could request a supply shipment from an organization or NPCs.
  * If your island is a survival game, this could be a way to provide critical supplies in a tough area.

If you're using multiple copies of a device on an island, it can be helpful to [rename](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#rename-a-device) them. You can choose names that relate to each device's purpose, so it's easier to remember what each one does.
##  Contextual Filtering
Some devices are affected by a feature called contextual filtering. This feature hides or displays options depending on the values selected for certain related options. This feature will reduce clutter in the Customize panel and make options easier to manage and navigate.
However, it may not be easy to recognize which options or values trigger contextual filtering. To help you identify them, in our device docs we use italic for any values that trigger contextual filtering. All options will be listed, including those affected by contextual filtering; if they are hidden or displayed based on a specific option’s value, there will be a note about that in the Description field for that option.
##  Device Options
Configure this device with the following options.
Default values are **bold**. Values that trigger contextual filtering are _italic_.
