![Billboard Devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/c9e89ad2-cdb8-40f6-9ee7-2837a6058c34?resizing_type=fill&width=1920&height=335)
You can use **Billboard** devices to display short messages to players in your game. These are useful for things like [onboarding](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) players or providing [in-game](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) instructions.
Each message can be up to 150 characters long. You can also use multiple billboards throughout your island.
In addition to controlling the content, you can control the text size, font, justification, and text effects. You can also choose the color of the text and the background.
For help on how to find the **Billboard** device, see [Using Devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-devices-in-fortnite). If you are using this in UEFN, you can find the device in the **Fortnite > Devices** folder.
If you're using multiple copies of a device on an island, it can be useful to [rename](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) them. Choosing names that relate to a device's purpose makes it easier to remember what each one does, and easier to find a specific device when using the [Event Browser](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/event-browser-in-fortnite-creative).
##  Device Options
This device has some basic functionality, like what text is displayed, the text size, and which font the text is using. There are also advanced options, like how far away players can read the billboard's text. In its [default](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) state, a Billboard device shows sample text, with invisible borders and a clear background.
You can configure this device with the following options.
Default values are **bold**.
Option  |  Value  |  Description

**Text** |  Enter text |  Type the message that you want to display on the billboard. While it is possible to enter up to 512 characters, how much of the text will display is influenced by both text size and the font used.
**Show Border** |  On, **Off** |  Controls whether the billboard's border is visible. If you set the **Show Border** option to **Off** , the collision properties of the device will also be turned off. That means players will be able to walk through the billboard. If you want the billboard to be solid, set the **Show Border** option to **On**.
