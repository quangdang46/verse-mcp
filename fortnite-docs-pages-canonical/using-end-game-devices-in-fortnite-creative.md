# End Game Devices
Determine when to end a round or game.
![End Game Devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/eeb08c76-e385-4619-98f1-a54d4fb93c27?resizing_type=fill&width=1920&height=335)
You can set the **End Game** device to end either the current [round](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) or the entire game, and determine which team met the conditions for the [win condition](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary).
This device can be activated by another device using [direct event binding](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary).
To find the End Game device, see [Using Devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-devices-in-fortnite).
If you're using multiple copies of a device on an island, it can be helpful to [rename](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) them. Choosing names that relate to a device's purpose makes it easier to remember what each one does, and easier to find a specific device when using the [Event Browser](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/event-browser-in-fortnite-creative).
##  Contextual Filtering
Some devices are affected by a feature called **contextual filtering**. This feature hides or displays options depending on the values selected for certain related options. This feature will reduce clutter in the Customize panel and make options easier to manage and navigate.
However, it may not be easy to recognize which options or values trigger contextual filtering. To help you identify them, in our device reference documents we use _italic_ for any values that trigger contextual filtering. All options will be listed, including those affected by contextual filtering; if they are hidden or displayed based on a specific option's value, there will be a note about that in the Description field for that option.
##  Device Options
This device has some basic functionality, like displaying custom victory callouts and determining which team wins the game as well as more advanced functions.
