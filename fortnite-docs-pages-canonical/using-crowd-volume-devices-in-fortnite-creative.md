The **Crowd Volume** device spawns a group of [NPCs](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) that you can use for crowd scenes, concert audiences, or anywhere else you want a group of NPCs focused on a particular event. Create a race game and put cheering crowds in the stands, or a musical experience using this device to pack the audience.
This device can also improve island performance by generating a crowd without the need for placing individual characters.
To find the Crowd Volume device, see [Using Devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-devices-in-fortnite).
If you're using multiple copies of a device on an island, it can be helpful to [rename](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) them. You can choose names that relate to each device's purpose, so it's easier to remember what each one does.
