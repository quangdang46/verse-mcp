# Pinball Bumper Devices
Use Pinball Bumper devices in your game to move, damage, and give score to your players.

When the **Pinball Bumper Device** is placed, any players that touch it will bounce backward and slightly upward with moderate force. You can use this with the [Pinball Flipper](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-pinball-flipper-devices-in-fortnite-creative) device to create pinball-like mechanics.
For help on how to find the **Pinball Bumper** device, see [Using Devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-devices-in-fortnite).
If you're using multiple copies of a device on an island, it can be useful to [rename](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite-creative/fortnite-creative-glossary#rename-a-device) them. Choosing names that relate to a device's purpose makes it easier to remember what each one does, and easier to find a specific device when using the [Event Browser](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/event-browser-in-fortnite-creative).
##  Contextual Filtering
Some devices are affected by a feature called **contextual filtering**. This feature hides or displays options depending on the values selected for certain related options. This feature will reduce clutter in the Customize panel and make options easier to manage and navigate.
However, it may not be easy to recognize which options or values trigger contextual filtering. To help you identify them, in our device docs we use _italic_ for any values that trigger contextual filtering. All options will be listed, including those affected by contextual filtering; if they are hidden or displayed based on a specific option's value, there will be a note about that in the Description field for that option.
##  Device Options
The Pinball Bumper device will activate when players on the correct team touch it on the top or the sides (depending on the options set). When the Pinball Bumper is activated, it makes a noise and knocks players back. The section on top of the Pinball Bumper will retract into the body until it is ready to activate again. If set to a non-glowing color, the Pinball Bumper will also briefly glow when activated.
You can control how much damage players take when knocked back by the Pinball Bumper, and whether it activates from both the top and the sides.
You can configure this device with the following options.
Default values are **bold**. Values that trigger contextual filtering are _italic_.
###  User Options
Option  |  Value  |  Description
---|---|---
**Knockback Player** |  Pick an amount |  How much force is applied to objects next to the Pinball Bumper when it is activated.
**Knockback Vehicle** |  Pick an amount |  How much force is applied to vehicles next to the Pinball Bumper when it is activated.
**Activating Team** |  **Any** , Pick a team |  The Pinball Bumper can only be activated by members of this team.
**Allow Side Bounce** |  **On** , Off |  Whether the device will activate when the player touches the side of the Pinball Bumper. Activating the device this way knocks players backward and away from the Pinball Bumper.
**Custom Side Lift Strength** |  On, **Off** |  If set, this option uses a separate set of values for bouncing when touching the side of the bumper.
**Side Bounce Lift Player** |  Pick a distance |  How much to knock the player in the air when the player hits the side of the bumper. Players stop quickly when in contact with the ground due to friction unless they have a slippery effect such as a Chiller trap or a [Grind Powerup](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#grind-powerup) applied to them. Because of this, **Side Bounce Lift** plays a major part in how far the players are knocked back.
**Side Bounce Lift Vehicle** |  Pick a distance |  When knocked sideways, how much a vehicle gets knocked up. Requires **Allow Side Bounce** to be set to On.
**Allow Top Bounce** |  **On** , Off |  Whether the Pinball Bumper activates when an object touches the top. Activating the device this way knocks objects directly upwards. With Side Bounce disabled, creators can use this to configure the bumper as a bounce pad with customizable strength.
**Bumper Color** |  **Blue** , Blue Glow, Red, Silver, Pink Glow, Green Glow, Orange Glow, Gold |  Determines the color of the bumper.
**Object Direction Importance** |  **100%** , Pick a percentage from 0% to 100% |  By default, the bumper takes the direction the object was moving when it hits the bumper, and uses that to determine the force it applies back. You can use Object Direction Importance to determine how much this is taken into account. At 0%, the direction of the object is ignored entirely and the object is always thrown directly away from the Pinball Bumper.
**Enabled At Game Start** |  **Yes** , No |  Determines whether the device is automatically enabled at game start, or if it needs to be enabled manually.
**Affects Creatures** |  Yes, **No** |  Determines whether this device can affect creatures and wildlife.

**Reset HUD Message Score** |  **Off** , On |  When the device displays a score message on the HUD, this determines whether it starts at zero.
**HUD Message** |  **Score!** , Enter text |  Determines what message is displayed on the HUD with the score. Use the default, or enter custom text. The text field has a limit of 150 characters.
**HUD Message Score Color** |  **#BFEBFFFF** , Pick a color |  Determines the color of the score displayed on the HUD. Click the swatch to open the Color Picker. You can click to select a swatch, or enter a Hex code in the Search bar to find that color. [![Color Picker](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/5f2071bf-ed0c-4992-8cea-7cc1b0569195?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/5f2071bf-ed0c-4992-8cea-7cc1b0569195?resizing_type=fit)
