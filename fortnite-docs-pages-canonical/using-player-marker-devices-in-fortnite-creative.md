**Player Marker** devices show players' positions on the [minimap](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#minimap), and you can choose what other information displays for marked players. Here are some examples:
  * [Health](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#health-bar) and [shield](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#shield) bars of marked players
  * Distance to a marked player

You can also change the appearance of the visual marker:
  * Determine whether the marker appears on the minimap.
  * Create a customized text label to display on marked players.
  * Choose an icon and the icon's color.

To find the Player Marker device, see [](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-devices-in-fortnite-creative)**[Using Devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-devices-in-fortnite)**.
If you're using multiple copies of a device on an island, it can be helpful to [rename](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#rename-a-device) them. Choosing names that relate to a device's purpose makes it easier to remember what each one does, and easier to find a specific device when using the [Event Browser](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/event-browser-in-fortnite-creative).
##  Contextual Filtering
Some devices are affected by a feature called **contextual filtering**. This feature hides or displays options depending on the values selected for certain related options. This reduces clutter in the Customize panel and makes options easier to manage and navigate. To help identify them, values that trigger contextual filtering are in _italic_.
All options are listed, including those affected by contextual filtering; if they are hidden or displayed based on a specific option's value, there will be a note about it in the Description field for that option.
##  Device Options
This device has some basic functionality, like auto saving and saving checkpoint data. Additionally, there are some advanced options, like saving a player's shield and health data.
