The **Prop-O-Matic Manager** affects how the [Prop-o-Matic](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#prop-o-matic) weapon functions, and how the game reacts to players that are using it. It has no effects of its own within the game, but only affects how a Prop-o-Matic weapon works.
Only one Prop-O-Matic Manager can be used on an island at a time.

##  Device Options
The Prop-O-Matic Manager passively adjusts how the game interacts with the Prop-O-Matic weapon. It has no effects of its own. By default, when placed, the Prop-O-Matic Manager assigns a 15-second [ping](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#ping) for players disguised as props, highlighting them for players searching for them. It also enables changing a player's [health](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#health) based on the size of the prop.
The Prop-O-Matic Manager can add [HUD messages](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) to the screen to let players know when the next ping will occur, and when it occurs, it pings the location of players on the island.
Default values are **bold**.
