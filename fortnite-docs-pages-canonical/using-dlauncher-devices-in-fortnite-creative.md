With the **D-Launcher** , you can launch players in specific directions at angles you set. Place them as aids to [traversal](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) in multi-level islands, or place them as hazards to obstruct players' progress.
Each type of launcher has a device option you can use to apply a low-gravity effect to whatever is launched. If this setting is active, movement is slower during launch so players can continue combat while moving.
The D-Launcher comes in three forms: **Standard** , **Primal** , and **Invasion**. This page describes the device options for all three forms. If a specific form isn't mentioned in an option description, it means the option values and defaults are the same for all three forms.

If you're using multiple copies of a device on an island, it can be helpful to [rename](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) them. You can choose names that relate to each device's purpose, so it's easier to remember what each one does.
