Fortnite Creative is converting many devices in the Fortnite Creative toolset to improve user experience across devices. These improvements include things like a better way for selecting colors or numeric values, more options for better device control and customization, and, for some devices, new functionality!
Currently, a public beta version of the upgraded devices is available for you to try. You can opt into using the beta toolset with both existing islands and new experiences. To learn how to implement the changes, refer to the [Upgrade Devices section](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-fishing-zone-devices-in-fortnite-creative) at the bottom of the document.
The **Fishing Zone** device provides a way for creators to add various fishing elements to their games, such as:
  * Fishing competitions between players
  * Collecting fish as a resource
  * A fun [minigame](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) with its own rewards

You can place a fishing pool in water, or you can place it in more unusual places like an artificial container or in lava. You can drop [items](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) onto the device, similar to an [Item Spawner](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) or [Item Granter](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary), so players can catch things besides fish.
To find the Dirt Bike Spawner device, see [Using Devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-devices-in-fortnite).
##  Contextual Filtering
Some devices are affected by a feature called **contextual filtering**. This feature hides or displays options depending on the values selected for certain related options. This feature will reduce clutter in the Customize panel and make options easier to manage and navigate.
However, it may not be easy to recognize which options or values trigger contextual filtering. To help you identify them, in our device docs we use _italic_ for any values that trigger contextual filtering. All options will be listed, including those affected by contextual filtering; if they are hidden or displayed based on a specific option’s value, there will be a note about that in the Description field for that option.
##  Device Options
