# Disguise Devices
Use the Disguise device to provide players the option to hide their true identity.

On this page
You can use the **Disguise** device to apply a disguise to players. Disguises are specific character outfits that change a player's appearance. You can use this device to create new types of gameplay:
  * Create stronger team identities.
  * Make more immersive roleplay mechanics.
  * Create social deduction games, where one or more players is secretly pitted against the other players.
  * Create a spy experience, where players must disguise themselves to infiltrate a location or organization.
  * Stage a jailbreak or other escape scenario, where disguises can help the players get away.


For help on how to find the **Disguise** device, see **[Using Devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-devices-in-fortnite)**.
If you're using multiple copies of a device on an island, it can be useful to rename them. Choosing names that relate to a device's purpose makes it easier to remember what each one does, and easier to find a specific device when using the [Event Browser](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/event-browser-in-fortnite-creative).
##  Using the Device 
Here is the general workflow for using this device.
  1. Decide how players can use the disguises. Choose which disguise the device will apply, and how the disguise behaves depending on a player's actions.
  2. Place the Disguise devices and determine how players will acquire the disguise.
  3. If your island uses teams or classes, set which team or class is able to use the disguise applied by this device.
  4. If your island has combat mechanics, set the options for how the disguise behaves when a disguised player attacks or takes damage.

##  Event Binding

  * In UEFN, you can find them in the **Details** panel under **User Options - Functions** and **User Options - Events**.


While you can set both functions and events in Creative (or in a Live Edit session in UEFN), you can only set functions in UEFN, and **events are read-only**.
##  Functions 
A function listens for an event on a device then performs an action. 
**In Creative, use the following steps to set a function.**
  1. For any function, click the option, then Select Device to access and select from the Device dropdown menu.
  2. Click Select Event to bind the device to an event that will trigger the function for the device.
  3. If more than one device or event triggers a function, click the Add button to add a line and repeat these steps.


**In UEFN, use the following steps to set a function.**
  1. With a device selected, locate the **User Options - Functions** section in the Details panel, and expand it.
  2. For any function, click the **+ (plus)** icon to add an array element.
  3. Click the first dropdown, and select a device. If you have a lot of devices, you can use the search bar to find one more easily.
  4. Click the second dropdown, and select the event you want to bind to this function.

---|---  
**Apply Disguise to Instigator When Receiving From** |  Applies the disguise to the instigating player when an event occurs.  
**Apply Disguise to All When Receiving From** |  Applies the disguise to all players when an event occurs.

**Enable When Receiving From** |  Enables the device when an event occurs.  
**Disable When Receiving From** |  Disables the device when an event occurs.  
##  Events 
An event tells another device when to perform a function.
Events in UEFN are **read-only**. When you set a function on another device that binds to an event on this device, the events are set automatically.
**In Creative, follow these steps to set an event:**
  1. For any function, click the option, then **Select Device** to access and select from the **Device** dropdown menu.
  2. Click **Select Function** to bind this event to a function for that device.
  3. If more than one function is triggered by the event, click the **Add** button to add a line and repeat these steps.
