# Teleporter Devices
Create a customizable rift that allows players to move instantly between locations.
![Teleporter Devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/511cedb5-b683-49e5-afab-5bea5334469d?resizing_type=fill&width=1920&height=335)
This is a customizable rift that moves players instantly between locations. The Teleporter device can be used to move players around your island, or create multi-island experiences with teleporters that take players from one island to another.
Teleporter devices can be set to visible, invisible, and silent. A silent, invisible teleporter can make gameplay exciting by transporting players suddenly from one place to another.
You can even group teleporters together to move players to areas on your island in the order you intend.
For help on how to find the **Teleporter** device, see [Using Devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-devices-in-fortnite).
If you're using multiple copies of a device on an island, it can be useful to rename them. Choosing names that relate to a device's purpose makes it easier to remember what each one does, and easier to find a specific device when using the [Event Browser](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/event-browser-in-fortnite-creative).
##  Device Options
The default state of the Teleporter is set up to immediately enable creators to set up a two-teleporter system. Placing two teleporters and changing no settings will automatically set up the ability to walk through one teleporter and end up at the other.
The default values are **bold**.

  * [Class Selector](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-teleporter-devices-in-fortnite-creative)

###  Moving All Players
A common use of the Teleporter is to move all players to a new area when changing phases of a game. For example, you may want to move players from a parkour phase to an elimination phase in different areas of the map.
**Devices used** :
  * 4 x **Teleporter**

  5. Select all three devices (Player Spawner, Player Reference, and Teleporter). Copy and paste them three additional times.
Make sure to select all three devices at once to ensure that all direct event bindings will be correct in the copies.
  6. Place a **Timed Objective** in an out-of-the-way location and customize it to the following settings:
[![Timed Objective Settings](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/aa6b13ae-cb4d-4415-b9ce-477a89a3df4c?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/aa6b13ae-cb4d-4415-b9ce-477a89a3df4c?resizing_type=fit)

  7. Set the direct event bindings of the Timed Objective to the following:
[![Timed Objective Events](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/98568a45-2fe6-427c-a68a-7e7fdc8d0f3d?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/98568a45-2fe6-427c-a68a-7e7fdc8d0f3d?resizing_type=fit)
Function  |  Device  |  Event  |  Description
---|---|---|---
On Completed Send Event To |  PlayerReference, PlayerReference2, PlayerReference3, PlayerReference4 |  Activate |  When the Timed Objective completes its countdown, it will activate all of the Player References, causing all players to teleport.

Here’s an overview of how devices communicate in this Design Example:
Device A  |  Function  |  Device B  |  Event  |  Explanation
---|---|---|---|---
**PlayerReference1-4** |  Register Player |  **PlayerSpawner1-4** |  On Player Spawned Send Event To |  When the player spawns, they will be registered to the Player Reference, allowing them to be teleported easily later on.
**Teleporter1-4** |  Teleport |  **PlayerReference1-4** |  On Activated Send Event To |  When the Player Reference is activated, it will teleport the referenced instigator to the Teleporter.
**PlayerReference1-4** |  Activate |  **TimedObjective** |  On Completed Send Event To |  When the Timed Objective completes its countdown, it will activate all of the Player References, causing all players to teleport.
You now have the base functionality for teleporting all players at once.
This technique is very useful in many game modes that feature multiple phases in different areas of the map. You can also use it to reset a game manually by moving all players back to the starting area.
If you want all players to teleport to the same place, you can move all of the Teleporters into the same spot using the **grid snap** tool. If you have to edit them manually, move them apart, make edits to the individual Teleporters, then move them back to the earlier position.

  8. Set the direct event bindings of the Teleporter to the following:
[![Entry Teleporter Event](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/1a2cc76c-6ebe-4b8a-8508-fceca60d0ae2?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/1a2cc76c-6ebe-4b8a-8508-fceca60d0ae2?resizing_type=fit)
Function  |  Device  |  Event  |  Description

  10. Repeat steps 7-9 for the Front Line and Sharpshooter classes. For the Front Line class, teleport the player to the front line. For the Sharpshooter class, teleport the player to the top of the sniper tower.
For additional clarity during gameplay, use billboards to label the different teleporters in the spawn area.

Here’s an overview of how devices communicate in this Design Example:
Device A  |  Function  |  Device B  |  Event  |  Explanation
---|---|---|---|---
**TurretClassSelector, FrontLineClassSelector, SharpshooterClassSelector** |  Change Player to Class |  **TurretTeleporter, FrontLineTeleporter, SharpshooterTeleporter** |  On Enter Send Event To |  When the player enters this Teleporter, they will be changed to the corresponding class.
You now have the base functionality for an advanced class selection system.
This example is useful in game modes where members of different classes begin in different areas and players are allowed to choose their own class.
To create a maximum number of players in a specific class, use [Player Counters](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-player-counter-devices-in-fortnite-creative) to keep track of how many players are in each class and then disable the Teleporters when the maximum has been reached.
Teleporters can also be limited to only members of certain classes. Consider having different Teleporters for different classes around a play area to create interesting gameplay scenarios and more complex strategies.
