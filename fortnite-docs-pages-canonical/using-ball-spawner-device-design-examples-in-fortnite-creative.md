# Ball Spawner Device Design Examples
Learn how to create dodgeball- or soccer-type mini-games.
![Ball Spawner Device Design Examples](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/ce9422aa-f6cd-4035-a8c7-6c46daa479af?resizing_type=fill&width=1920&height=335)
The **Ball Spawner** device spawns a ball that can be knocked around by players or objects. A player can shove it, shoot it, or hit it with a pickaxe to knock it in a specific direction.
Keep going for a couple of examples of how you can use this device:
  * [Dodgeball Last Player Standing](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-ball-spawner-device-design-examples-in-fortnite-creative)
  * [Soccer Score Mini-Game](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-ball-spawner-device-design-examples-in-fortnite-creative)

##  Dodgeball Last Player Standing
Did you know that the balls spawned by the Ball Spawner can be used to eliminate other players?
In this design example, you’ll learn how to create a four-player game where players bounce the ball to eliminate each other, and the last player standing wins!
###  Devices Used
  * 4 x [Player Spawner devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-player-spawn-pad-devices-in-fortnite-creative)
  * 1 x **Ball Spawner** device
  * 1 x [**Damage Volume** device](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-damage-volume-devices-in-fortnite-creative)

###  Build Your Own
Start by making a simple arena for the action, which will help keep the players focused on the ball.
[![](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/39bc748c-9d98-412b-8305-15581a9b86dd?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/39bc748c-9d98-412b-8305-15581a9b86dd?resizing_type=fit)
In this example, the walls of the game space are made from sloped pieces that roll the ball back into play, but you could make your walls any shape you choose!
###  Add Player Spawners
Place a player spawner on one of the raised platforms at the corners of the arena.
[![](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/98d4a214-9217-40d4-bd00-f9b13027109d?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/98d4a214-9217-40d4-bd00-f9b13027109d?resizing_type=fit)
  1. Configure the spawner to be invisible during the game.
[![](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/22b64b47-d6df-4489-a849-d8080639026b?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/22b64b47-d6df-4489-a849-d8080639026b?resizing_type=fit)
Option  |  Value  |  Description
---|---|---
**Visible in Game** |  Off |  Player spawners disappear when the game starts.
  2. Copy the configured spawner to the remaining corners.

###  Add the Ball Spawner
Add the Ball Spawner device over the center of the arena.
[![](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/314f1213-5a76-42aa-82f9-43b5ab427bcf?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/314f1213-5a76-42aa-82f9-43b5ab427bcf?resizing_type=fit)
In this example, the ball spawner is visible during gameplay so players have a reference point for where the ball will fall from. It is also turned upside down to allow the ball to fall freely.
A player has to use their pickaxe to propel the ball into another player, but if they don't time their swing well, the ball will touch them, and they are eliminated!
  1. Set the following options for the ball:
[![](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/dddc1f87-3e8f-4177-b0ed-a8b26116a7d1?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/dddc1f87-3e8f-4177-b0ed-a8b26116a7d1?resizing_type=fit)
Option  |  Value  |  Description
---|---|---
**Enabled During Phase** |  Gameplay Only |  The ball will spawn only after the game starts.
Ball Color |  optional |  Use the default color, or pick your own!
Eliminate Player When Touched |  On |  This causes a player to be eliminated when another player propels the ball into them.
  2. On the **Functions** tab, set the ball spawner to **Enable When Receiving From** the first **Player Spawner** in the area.
[![](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/eac202f7-fb32-4ddb-af1e-24003a155ef4?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/eac202f7-fb32-4ddb-af1e-24003a155ef4?resizing_type=fit)

###  Add a Damage Volume
To encourage players to jump into the arena and start bouncing the ball at their rivals, add a Damage Volume device that covers the player spawners.
The **Damage Volume** device is to encourage players to jump into the game. If they don't the damage volume will eliminate them. You can spell this out for the players in [onboarding](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/onboarding-players-in-fortnite-creative), or let them learn the hard way!
[![](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/353cf258-c2fc-42a4-a0c7-31d8d9a9bf6f?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/353cf258-c2fc-42a4-a0c7-31d8d9a9bf6f?resizing_type=fit)
  1. Set the size of the damage volume.

Option  |  Value  |  Description
---|---|---
**Zone Width** |  5 |  These dimensions make it possible to cover all of the player spawners with a single volume.
**Zone Height** |  5 |  These dimensions make it possible to cover all of the player spawners with a single volume.
  2. Go to [**Functions**](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/getting-started-with-direct-event-binding-in-fortnite-creative) and set the following:
[![](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/4940c9c1-ccf8-4867-9945-64d729edb9b8?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/4940c9c1-ccf8-4867-9945-64d729edb9b8?resizing_type=fit)

##  Soccer Score Mini-Game
Ready for another simple ball-based game?
This soccer-style mini-game features a scoring system where the first team to earn five goals wins.
###  Devices Used
  * 4 x [Player Spawner devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-player-spawn-pad-devices-in-fortnite-creative)

###  Build Your Own
Build a simple playing field that's big enough to allow player movement, but that will constrain player actions to the area.
In this example, the arena walls are made from sloped pieces that roll the ball back into play, but feel free to get creative when you shape your soccer field!
[![](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/1a932164-dcf7-42e7-86b1-1948e2e88163?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/1a932164-dcf7-42e7-86b1-1948e2e88163?resizing_type=fit)
Add a [**soccer goal prop**](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-prefabs-and-galleries-in-fortnite-creative) to each end of the field.
For a more authentic look, use the goal object from the **Sports Gallery** set in the **Pleasant Park** gallery.
[![](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/7c6efff5-c34a-4197-bdad-388a4b0e423a?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/7c6efff5-c34a-4197-bdad-388a4b0e423a?resizing_type=fit)
###  Add Player Spawner Devices

**Player Team** |  Team 1 |  You will set two spawners to **Team 1** and the other two to **Team 2**.
**Use as Island Start** |  On |  This is the default value and should stay to **On**.
**Visible in Game** |  Off |  Once the game starts, the player spawners should not be visible.
  2. Copy and place another player spawner next to the first. At this point you should have two spawners at one end of the field.
  3. Copy and place a third spawner, but at the other end of the field.
  4. Change **Player Team** to **Team 2** , then copy and place a second Team 2 spawner next to it.

  2. Turn the ball spawner upside down to allow the ball to drop freely into the field when it spawns. Configure the ball spawner to be enabled during gameplay only.
[![](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/0aed9fa9-ffee-4116-95b3-b5f92163f24d?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/0aed9fa9-ffee-4116-95b3-b5f92163f24d?resizing_type=fit)
