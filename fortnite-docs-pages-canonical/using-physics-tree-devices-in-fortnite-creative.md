# Physics Tree Devices
Place a tree that can be chopped down, and the falling tree can damage structures, vehicles, players or creatures. This can create new hazards and obstacles for your players to overcome.

The **Physics Tree** is a large tree that can be chopped down by players. Unlike typical trees in Fortnite, which disappear when destroyed, this tree has a trunk that will fall after taking a certain amount of damage (becoming a log). The log can crash down through structures, people or creatures, depending on where you place it. It is subject to physics and gravity, so it will collide with players, creatures, vehicles, structures, and terrain. You can determine the maximum amount of [damage](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#damage) the log does when it hits something (although the actual damage depends on the speed of the tree on impact).
For help on how to find the Physics Tree device, see [Using Devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-devices-in-fortnite).
If you're using multiple copies of a device on an island, it can be useful to rename them. Choosing names that relate to a device's purpose makes it easier to remember what each one does, and easier to find a specific device when using the [Event Browser](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/event-browser-in-fortnite-creative).

**Damage to Environment** |  None, **1200 (Default)** , Pick an amount |  Determines the maximum damage a log can do to the environment on each hit. Actual damage to environmental objects depends on the velocity of the log when it hits.
**Timed Tree Respawn** |  **15M** , None, Pick an amount of time |  Determines how long it takes for a tree to respawn after it is chopped down.
**Spawn When Enabled** |  **Yes** , No |  Determines whether the tree automatically spawns when the device is enabled.
