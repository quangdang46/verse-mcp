# Round Settings Devices
With this device, developers can further customize individual game rounds, or all rounds in the game.
![Round Settings Devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/64940353-c1ae-4bd7-b3e3-84f591ad760b?resizing_type=fill&width=1920&height=335)
The **Round Settings** device is used for any round-based game that has customized gameplay within specific rounds. It generally defines what happens to the player’s inventory and rewards in each round. An example of a game mode that uses Round Settings extensively is [Search and Destroy](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/search-and-destroy).
For help on how to find the **Round Settings** device, see [Using Devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-devices-in-fortnite).
If you're using multiple copies of a device on an island, it can be useful to rename them. Choosing names that relate to a device's purpose makes it easier to remember what each one does, and easier to find a specific device when using the [Event Browser](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/event-browser-in-fortnite-creative).
##  Contextual Filtering
Some devices are affected by a feature called contextual filtering. This feature hides or displays options depending on the values selected for certain related options. This feature will reduce clutter in the Customize panel and make options easier to manage and navigate.
However, it may not be easy to recognize which options or values trigger contextual filtering. To help you identify them, in our device docs we use  _italic_ for any values that trigger contextual filtering. All options will be listed, including those affected by contextual filtering; if they are hidden or displayed based on a specific option's value, there will be a note about that in the Description field for that option.
##  Device Options
This device lets you manage your players' inventory and rewards between rounds, for example classes, weapons, items, and building resources.
In its default state, this device does nothing. It grants no resources and does not decide what happens to resources between rounds.
You can configure this device with the following options.
Default values are **bold**. Values that trigger contextual filtering are _italic_.
The Round Settings device can override My Island settings. Refer to the following documents for more information about My Island settings:
