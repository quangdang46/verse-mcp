Wildlife spawners can spawn an array of creatures, some of which you can hunt, tame, or ride! You're about to learn some fun ways to integrate a few of these creatures into your own gameplay design.
##  Basic Animal Hazard
In this example, you'll see how to use a **Wildlife Spawner** device to configure animals that are hazardous for players!
###  Devices Used
  * 1 x [Wildlife Spawner](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-wildlife-spawner-devices-in-fortnite-creative) device
  * 1 x [Player Spawner](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-player-spawn-pad-devices-in-fortnite-creative) device
  * 1 x [Item Granter](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-item-granter-devices-in-fortnite-creative) device

###  Set Up the Devices
  1. Place a **Player Spawner** device.
  2. Place an **Item Granter** device and register a **Makeshift Bow** to the device.
  3. Customize the Item Granter:

Type |  Wildwasps
Spawn Radius |  40.0M

You now have the basic functionality for an animal hazard!
###  Design Tip
Consider which animals make the most sense to be spawning in your Island — it might not make sense to spawn a wolf on a desert island, for instance.
To make the wildlife blend in more with your environment, explore the biome variants on chickens, boars, and wolves!
##  Timed Chicken Capture
The Wildlife Spawner can spawn chickens. Fortnite chickens can be picked up, jumped with, and thrown by the player! This makes them a fun option for a timed capture challenge.

###  Bind Functions and Events
[Direct event binding](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite-creative/fortnite-creative-glossary#directeventbinding) is how you set devices to communicate directly with other devices. This involves setting [functions](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite-creative/fortnite-creative-glossary#function) and [events](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite-creative/fortnite-creative-glossary#event) for the devices involved.
  1. Configure the following event on the **Volume** device so it stops the **Timer** device if a chicken enters the pen.

Event  |  Select Device  |  Select Function
---|---|---
On Enter |  Timer Device |  Reset

You now have the basic functionality for a timed chicken capture challenge!
###  Design Tip
Think about other interesting ways to interact with these fowl creatures. You could use a chicken to give a player a boost in jump height or provide a slow glide, or maybe use a chicken toss to trigger a new phase of gameplay in a puzzle game!
##  Build a Raptor Companion Adventure
Some spawned wildlife can be tamed by players and become a player's companion.
In this example, you'll see how to give the player a Raptor that the player can tame, and ride, and that can help in combat!

###  Design Tip
Consider how raptors and other rideable animals can spruce up your gameplay. The unique jump height boost on the raptor can give players new traversal possibilities, and the energy settings on the Wildlife Spawner device provide fine control over movement strength for spawned animals.
Also think about how you can use tamable animals as a combat advantage for players to discover!
