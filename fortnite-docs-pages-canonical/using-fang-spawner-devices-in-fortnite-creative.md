# Fang Spawner Devices
Spawn cool cars on your island to give players a fast and stylish vehicle they can use to get around!
![Fang Spawner Devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/3fa5fe70-c052-4af1-a88c-2e436307b652?resizing_type=fill&width=1920&height=335)
Use the **Fang Spawner** to place any of three variants of the Fang car on your island. Choose which variant you want to use with the **Vehicle Type** option:
  * **Nitro Fang:** Make each spawned vehicle have a random color, or set a specific color that is applied to all vehicles spawned from the device.
  * **Pizza Pit Fang:** A pizza-delivery vehicle that can also be used as a getaway car.
  * **Thorne's Fang:** A cool car for a tough boss!

The cars spawned from the Fang Spawner handle similarly to the Nitro Drifter sedan. They have:
  * Better traction
  * Higher acceleration, particularly in the lower gears
  * Higher top speed than the basic sedan
  * Ability to [drift](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) (engage handbrake to slide sideways while moving forward)

For help on how to find the **Fang Spawne** r device, see [Using Devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite-creative/using-devices-in-fortnite-creative).
If you're using multiple copies of a device on an island, it can be helpful to [rename](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) them. You can choose names that relate to each device’s purpose, so it’s easier to remember what each one does.
##  Contextual Filtering
Some devices are affected by a feature called **contextual filtering**. This feature hides or displays options depending on the values selected for certain related options. This feature will reduce clutter in the Customize panel and make options easier to manage and navigate.
However, it may not be easy to recognize which options or values trigger contextual filtering. To help you identify them, in our device docs we use _italic_ for any values that trigger contextual filtering. All options will be listed, including those affected by contextual filtering; if they are hidden or displayed based on a specific option’s value, there will be a note about that in the Description field for that option.
##  Device Options
This device has some basic functionality, like choosing a visual type, and setting the car's color to be either random or a specific color. Additionally, there are some advanced options, like which teams and [classes](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) can use the cars spawned by this device.
