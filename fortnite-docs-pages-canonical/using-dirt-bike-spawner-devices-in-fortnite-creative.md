The **Dirt Bike** is a fast and agile vehicle, fun for races or combat games! Players can shoot weapons while speeding down a straightaway or cornering curves or just go for the finish line.
To find the Dirt Bike Spawner device, see [Using Devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-devices-in-fortnite).
If you're using multiple copies of a device on an island, it can be helpful to [rename](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) them. You can choose names that relate to each device's purpose, so it's easier to remember what each one does.
##  Contextual Filtering
Some devices are affected by a feature called **contextual filtering**. This feature hides or displays options depending on the values selected for certain related options. This feature will reduce clutter in the Customize panel and make options easier to manage and navigate.
However, it may not be easy to recognize which options or values trigger contextual filtering. To help you identify them, in our device docs we use _italic_ for any values that trigger contextual filtering. All options will be listed, including those affected by contextual filtering; if they are hidden or displayed based on a specific option’s value, there will be a note about that in the Description field for that option.
##  Device Options
This device has some basic functionality, like determining whether the spawner is visible during the game. Additionally, there are some advanced options, like determining whether the vehicle is indestructible and whether it destroys itself when it is stuck underwater.
Default values are **bold**. Values that trigger contextual filtering are _italic_.
You can configure this device with the following options.
