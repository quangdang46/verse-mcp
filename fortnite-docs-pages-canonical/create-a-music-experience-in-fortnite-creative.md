# Music Experience
Create your own engaging environment while using the Video Player device to magnify the musical experience.
![Music Experience](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/a4e21b93-a426-44ed-b587-9f9f20a3317e?resizing_type=fill&width=1920&height=335)
In this tutorial, you will learn to make a visually engaging stage for showcasing music videos with the **Video Player** device. You'll start by building and decorating the main stage, then use sequencers and triggers to create a dynamicly changing show of lights and visual effects.
The sample island code for this tutorial is **6609-9553-9188**. Head to the [Fortnite lobby](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) to take a look!
Note the different features of the island, then come back and explore this tutorial to see how you can recreate it on your own island.

##  Overview of Tutorial Steps
Following is an overview of the steps you'll need to recreate this island and their ideal sequence:
  1. Create a new island using a [starter island](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#starter-island).
  2. Customize the island settings.
  3. Build the music stage.
  4. Place devices on the music stage.
  5. Place [background devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) outside behind the music stage.

##  Props, Prefabs, and Galleries
A variety of [props](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#prop) and [gallery](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#gallery) items were used, mostly from the **Structures Gallery Reflective Black** , **Disco Gallery** , and **Customizable Light Gallery** , to create this arena with a music hall theme. Feel free to use your own inspiration or ideas instead to create a theme from the other prefabs and galleries available, still following the basic build design steps in this tutorial.
Check out our short [video tutorials](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-video-tutorials) to learn more about the beginning steps to create your island.
##  Create Your Island
  1. To [build your island](https://mediaspace.unrealengine.com/media/Creating+an+Island/1_mi1aqt1y/208434573), find your [personal rift](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#personal-rift) in the main [hub](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#hub). Your personal rift will be the one with the golden glow.
  2. Use the [console](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#console) next to your rift to create a new island. Press **E** to enter the **Game Creation** screen and click **Create New**.
[![Select Island Grid](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/2911ce36-7a1a-4fed-8d38-6b456c8efb4e?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/2911ce36-7a1a-4fed-8d38-6b456c8efb4e?resizing_type=fit)
  3. Under the **Starter Island** tab, there are three grid islands that vary by memory allocation — Grid Island, Large Grid Island, and XL Grid Island. For this tutorial, choose the **Grid Island** , and click **Confirm**.
  4. Name your island, then click **Confirm** again.
  5. The portal will automatically load your new island, then teleport you to the island.

##  Building the Music Stage
[![Video Player Overview](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/1238107b-1ca4-4682-a2c3-2257d30de719?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/1238107b-1ca4-4682-a2c3-2257d30de719?resizing_type=fit)
The arena is roughly 11 [tiles](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#tile) wide and 8 tiles deep, curved towards one end. The stage is slightly raised, and will house the majority of decorations and devices. An open floor is before this stage, with a switch to activate the devices. This is where players can use [emotes](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#emote), watch the video, or interact with the guards that are spawned.
###  Prefabs and Galleries Used
The **Structures Gallery Reflective Black** and **Disco Gallery** were primarily used to construct this island. These can be found on the [Galleries tab](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary)
[![Video Player Galleries](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/6a1caa03-fc17-44cc-aebd-006beaff6b3f?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/6a1caa03-fc17-44cc-aebd-006beaff6b3f?resizing_type=fit)
_Click image to expand._
You can use any gallery set to create this gameplay example, but Structures Gallery Reflective Black and Disco Gallery pieces were primarily used for this tutorial. Feel free to take other elements you like from other [galleries](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#gallery) or [prefabs](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#prefab) to give your music stage its own character.
Press the **Tab** key to go into the [Creative Inventory](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary). Click the **Galleries** tab, and find the following galleries:
  * **Structures Gallery Reflective Black**
  * **Disco Gallery**
  * Any other gallery you want.

  1. Set up the floors first for your music stage. This will outline a basic framework to expand from going forward, and help you line up other parts.
[![Flooring Setup](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/96ce1bbe-5752-4214-8aed-b4989ac88f6e?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/96ce1bbe-5752-4214-8aed-b4989ac88f6e?resizing_type=fit)
  2. Next, begin building the stage, with the flooring as a rough outline. Curve it at the end to give the stage a more dynamic look. Add stairs and outcroppings to place elements on, following the rough framework shown above, or explore the sample island for other ideas.
It might be helpful at some points while building to set **Build As Prop** to **Origin Center** in the [Quick Menu](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#quick-menu). This lets you rotate and adjust the size of any item in the same way you would a prop, although it will make it more difficult to place walls, floors and gallery pieces. Use [grid snap](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#grid-snap) to get around this problem, or learn by trial and error until it gets easier.
[![Stage Setup](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/6eabd69f-4445-4957-85b9-fed0ae554b45?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/6eabd69f-4445-4957-85b9-fed0ae554b45?resizing_type=fit)
  3. Finish building the main stage by following the basic line of the flooring, as shown below. Don't worry about clipping out the rear portion, as that will be hidden by the walls. Focus on the stage itself being seamless, even if it takes multiple overlapping pieces to cover all the holes.
[![Stage Setup 2](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/4ebee16b-06e2-4cf2-80c8-dfd292ff325e?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/4ebee16b-06e2-4cf2-80c8-dfd292ff325e?resizing_type=fit)
  4. Next, start setting up the walls. Use grid snap if possible for perfect alignment, and stretch wall pieces wider and taller to set them to the final dimensions as best you can. Pieces can jut behind the walls as players will not see this.
[![Wall Setup](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/586f4250-a9bf-4c29-9f36-9784f5b4fde8?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/586f4250-a9bf-4c29-9f36-9784f5b4fde8?resizing_type=fit)
  5. Finish laying the foundation for your stage by placing the walls around the entirety of the music stage and along the sides, leaving just the back part open. As shown, some extension past other areas is fine if the heights and alignment are proper and even.
[![Wall Setup 2](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/d75dcb77-2fde-4138-87b1-032f9915666a?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/d75dcb77-2fde-4138-87b1-032f9915666a?resizing_type=fit)
  6. The Disco Gallery has many useful props you can use on your island, such as sound systems. For example, placing amps on your stage give an apparent audio source for the music video.
[![Decorate Setup](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/711f4c31-c345-414f-8264-1f8e585c7fb9?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/711f4c31-c345-414f-8264-1f8e585c7fb9?resizing_type=fit)
  7. By pulling other pieces from the galleries, such as a girder, additional sound systems can be created piecemeal to fit the theme for the stage. Be creative in what you make, and use what is there already for inspiration.
[![Decorate Setup 2](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/17c160f7-3b63-4be0-b09f-dbf064fb9772?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/17c160f7-3b63-4be0-b09f-dbf064fb9772?resizing_type=fit)
  8. Use moving spotlights in key places to add the first touches of light. Some pieces exist that cannot be customized but will still move around on their own. These spotlights will move back and forth, sending beams into the sky.
[![Decorate Setup 3](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/a120d64c-d070-4064-a189-799b1e1e8a09?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/a120d64c-d070-4064-a189-799b1e1e8a09?resizing_type=fit)

Below, you can see the completed music stage with the elements chosen so far. Explore the galleries and prefabs for other props that might make good additional decorations.
[![Decorate Setup 4](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/f542ac54-fed8-476d-bce4-316735f818cd?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/f542ac54-fed8-476d-bce4-316735f818cd?resizing_type=fit)

###  Video Player
[![Video Player](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/00a124ef-7c3f-4b0b-ba04-d4294221755e?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/00a124ef-7c3f-4b0b-ba04-d4294221755e?resizing_type=fit)
  1. Locate the **Video Player** device in the Creative inventory. Place one player at default size on the corner wall of the stage.
  2. Customize it with the following settings.
[![Video Player Settings](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/a511179e-1b3c-4d81-8f16-1034c386d798?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/a511179e-1b3c-4d81-8f16-1034c386d798?resizing_type=fit)

  3. Copy the Video Player device and place the copy on the lower portion of the stage. Using the **Resize** option in the [Create mode hotkeys](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#create-mode-hotkeys), customize it to its maximum dimensions to create the main screen in the center wall of the music hall.
[![Video Player 2](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/f1bf15ac-aeb4-4ab6-8713-f8fd37e95370?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/f1bf15ac-aeb4-4ab6-8713-f8fd37e95370?resizing_type=fit)
