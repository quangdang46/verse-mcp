# Water Devices
Create bodies of water like lakes, ponds or canals that players can swim and fish in, or drive boats on!
![Water Devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/a7597e62-6e1a-4c89-b62e-42163f9c9547?resizing_type=fill&width=1920&height=335)
You can use the **Water device** to create a body of water on your island that players can interact with. You can control the water level, and make it increase or decrease with triggered events.
The device creates water within a specific [volume](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#volume), which you can customize to create lakes, ponds, oceans, swimming pools, sewers, and so on. Players can swim in these bodies of water, or drive boats on them. You can also place [fishing zones](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-fishing-zone-devices-in-fortnite-creative) in these bodies of water so that players can fish.
For information on finding devices see [**Using Devices**](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-devices-in-fortnite-creative). To find the Water device in UEFN, open the Content Drawer and click **Fortnite > Devices > Environment**.
If you're using multiple copies of a device on an island, it can be helpful to [rename](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#rename-a-device) them. You can choose names that relate to each device's purpose, so it's easier to remember what each one does.
