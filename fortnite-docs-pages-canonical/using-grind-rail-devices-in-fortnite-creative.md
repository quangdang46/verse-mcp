# Grind Rail Devices
Place a customizable rail that you can move and shape for the perfect grind!
![Grind Rail Devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/6345ecdc-52c4-4b45-8a6b-f58fbf568575?resizing_type=fill&width=1920&height=335)
A **Grind Rail** is a flexible rail that a player can slide on to move quickly from one point to another. Grind Rails, along with [Ziplines](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-zipline-devices-in-fortnite-creative), are fun ways for players to [traverse](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) your island.
With the **Grind Rail** device, you can create grind rails in any length, and with all the curves, twists, and turns you can dream up!
Grind Rail devices in Creative are similar to [AI Patrol Path](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/ai-patrol-path-node-device) devices in that they have two nodes (called Control Points) when first placed. However, the Grind Rail has two parts: the rail itself, and the Control Points you use to define and edit the shape and length of the rail.
A minimum of two Control Points is required to define each end of the rail — if you remove all but one Control Point, it will remove the entire rail.
To find the **Grind Rail** device, see [Using Devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-devices-in-fortnite).
If you're using multiple copies of a device on an island, it can be helpful to rename them. Choosing names that relate to a device's purpose makes it easier to remember what each one does, and easier to find a specific device when using the [Event Browser](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/event-browser-in-fortnite-creative).
##  Shaping the Grind Rail
Select a Control Point from either end of the rail. Use the Phone tool **Copy** function on one of the original two Control Points to add a new point to the rail.
[![Copy and place control points to add new curves and bends.](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/e44da9b7-733b-4836-9fcd-c7f96a87baeb?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/e44da9b7-733b-4836-9fcd-c7f96a87baeb?resizing_type=fit)
Move the Control Point in any direction. The shape of the rail will follow.
Make sure you have the point selected, and not the rail. If you select the rail instead of a point, you will move the entire rail instead of just the Control Point.
Use the phon's **Cut** function to move a Control Point to a different position on the rail, or to change the rail's length. To safely remove one or more Control Points, use the phone's **Select** function on the point before you delete.
**Rotating** a point adjusts the direction of the grind rail as it goes through that point, which is how you create curves and turns. You can adjust the sharpness or roundness of the curve by adjusting the **Tangent Intensity** option (see [Control Point Device Options](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-grind-rail-devices-in-fortnite-creative) below).
##  Device Options
The Grind Rail and Control Points are customized separately, and each has its own Customize panel.
Default values are **bold**.
###  Control Point
To customize a Control Point, select it first. Make sure you're selecting the point, not the rail.
[![Select a control point to customize it.](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/bb1f9ba2-615e-41ce-815c-28ec55fe328b?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/bb1f9ba2-615e-41ce-815c-28ec55fe328b?resizing_type=fit)
There is only one option you can modify.
Option  |  Value  |  Description
---|---|---
**Tangent Intensity** |  **300.0** , Pick or enter a positive number |  This determines how sharp or rounded the curve in the grind rail is. The higher the number, the more rounded the curve. Use this in combination with the direction of the Control Point to create curves, twists and turns in your grind rails.
###  Rail
To customize the rail, select it first. Make sure that you're not selecting a control point when you want to customize the rail.
[![Select the rail to customize it.](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/dc5ebe92-9101-4b56-a17a-7ee80e1ee104?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/dc5ebe92-9101-4b56-a17a-7ee80e1ee104?resizing_type=fit)
You can configure the rail with the following options.
Option  |  Value  |  Description
---|---|---
**Visual Style** |  **_Standard_** , _Wire_ , _Vine_ , Minerail |  You can change the look of the grind rail from the default to a wire, a vine, or a minerail (the track that mine carts travel on). If you select **Wire** or **Vine** for this option, additional options will display.
**Rail Color** |  **#D94716** , Pick a color |  This option only appears if you have the **Visual Style** option is set to **Standard**. Determines the color for the grind rail. Click the color swatch to open the Color Picker. Each color swatch has a hex code next to the swatch. You can also type a hex code into the search bar to find a specific color. Select a color, then click the checkmark. [![Color Picker](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/a0d9ac8d-9584-41d3-91f8-588045766c63?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/a0d9ac8d-9584-41d3-91f8-588045766c63?resizing_type=fit)

  * **Standard** : 380
  * **Small-Scale** : 450

**Max Speed Hard Cap** |  **Use Speed Preset** , Pick or enter a rate |  Determines the absolute maximum speed a player can reach on the grind rail. This caps all other speeds including Base Max Speed, Sprinting Max Speed, and the speed gained on a downward slope. Default values:

Minimum Speed |  400 cm/s, Pick or enter a speed |  Determines the minimum speed a player can go while grinding. If the **Can Turn Around** option is set to **Yes** , going below the set Minimum Speed will cause the player to turn around on the rail. This speed cannot be higher than the speed set in the **Max Speed Hard Cap** option.
**Minimum Start Speed** |  **Use Speed Preset** , Pick or enter a rate |  Determines the minimum grinding speed for the player if they are standing still when entering the grind rail.

  * **Small-Scale** : 1000 cm/s

**Landing Speed Boost** |  **Use Speed Preset** , Pick or enter a rate |  Determines the boost in speed the player gets when they start to grind by landing on the grind rail.

  * **Standard** : 800 cm/s
  * **Small-Scale** : 250 cm/s

**Jump Height** |  **Use Speed Preset** , Pick or enter an amount |  Determines how high the player can jump while grinding. This can affect the player's ability to jump to another rail, so rail positioning may need to be tuned if this value is changed.  Default values:

  * **Small-Scale** : 750 cm/s

**Gravity Force When Going Up** |  **Use Speed Preset** , Pick or enter a number |  Determines the force of gravity on a grinding player when going up a slope. Lower values make it easier to go up slopes.  Default values:

  * **Small-Scale** : 1150

**Gravity Force When Going Down** |  **Use Speed Preset** , Pick or enter a number |  Determines the force of gravity on a grinding player when going down a slope. Higher values cause a player's velocity to increase when going down slopes.  Default values:
  * **Standard** : 1950
  * **Small-Scale** : 1950

**Forced Direction** |  **_None_** , Forward, Backward |  Determines the direction the player has to grind in, regardless of the direction they started grinding from.

If this option is set to either **Forward** or **Backward** , the **Can Turn Around** option does not appear.
**Can Turn Around** |  **Yes** , No |  Determines if players can turn around and grind in the other direction. By default, players will turn the other direction when their grinding speed falls below the value set in the **Minimum Speed** option.
