The **Item Remover** gives gives you the ability to designate events in your games that will cause players to [drop](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#drop) or lose items from their [inventory](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#inventory). For example, if a player is [Down But Not Out](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#down-but-not-out), they could drop items from their inventory, and other players could then pick up those items.
To find the Item Remover device, see **[Using Devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-devices-in-fortnite)**.

If you're using multiple copies of a device on an island, it can be helpful to [rename](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#rename-a-device) them. Choosing names that relate to a device's purpose makes it easier to remember what each one does, and easier to find a specific device when using the [Event Browser](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/event-browser-in-fortnite-creative).
##  Contextual Filtering 
Some devices are affected by a feature called **contextual filtering**. This feature hides or displays options depending on the values selected for certain related options. This reduces clutter in the Customize panel and makes options easier to manage and navigate. To help identify them, values that trigger contextual filtering are in _italic_.
All options are listed, including those affected by contextual filtering; if they are hidden or displayed based on a specific option's value, there will be a note about it in the Description field for that option.
