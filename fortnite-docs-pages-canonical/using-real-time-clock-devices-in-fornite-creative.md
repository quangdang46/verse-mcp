# Real Time Clock Devices
Use this to tie in-game events to real time.
![Real Time Clock Devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/dc05537c-4fb7-4ddc-b37c-36039a255352?resizing_type=fill&width=1920&height=335)
The **Real Time Clock** can be used to connect things that happen in the game to time periods in the real world. Here are some things you can use this for in your game:
  * Events in the game can be linked to time periods in the real world, so those things are only available to players during the day or at night.
  * You can have the device display as a countdown timer to an event in your game, or it can show the real-world time.
  * You can have tasks the player must do within a certain time period, such as feed a pet or grow a plant.
  * You can keep players from entering an event until a certain time, with a countdown displaying how much time is left before the event starts.

For help on how to find the **Real Time Clock** device, see [Using Devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-devices-in-fortnite).
If you're using multiple copies of a device on an island, it can be useful to rename them. Choosing names that relate to a device's purpose makes it easier to remember what each one does, and easier to find a specific device when using the [Event Browser](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/event-browser-in-fortnite-creative).
##  Contextual Filtering
Some devices are affected by a feature called **contextual filtering**. This feature hides or displays options depending on the values selected for certain related options. This feature will reduce clutter in the Customize panel and make options easier to manage and navigate.
However, it may not be easy to recognize which options or values trigger contextual filtering. To help you identify them, in our device docs we use _italic_ for any values that trigger contextual filtering. All options will be listed, including those affected by contextual filtering; if they are hidden or displayed based on a specific option's value, there will be a note about that in the **Description** field for that option.
##  Device Options
This device has some basic functionality, like choosing the style of the clock face, and setting the time, date and year. Additionally, there are some advanced options, like choosing a time zone and setting the display mode.
You can configure this device with the following options.
Default values are **bold**. Values affected by contextual filtering are in _italic_.
