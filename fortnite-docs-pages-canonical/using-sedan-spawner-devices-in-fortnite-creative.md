Place a sedan vehicle in your game for your players to drive.
![Sedan Spawner Devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/4a250b31-17cc-4ff9-9d0d-ed08b5a1e2cd?resizing_type=fill&width=1920&height=335)
The **Sedan Spawner** is a device that [spawns](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#spawning) a sedan vehicle your island at the spawner's given location and orientation.
  * Use Sedan Spawner devices in combination with the [Race Checkpoint Device](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#race-checkpoint) to design a racing game for your players.
  * You can place a player directly inside the sedan using a trigger.

For help on how to find the **Sedan Spawner** device, see [Using Devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-devices-in-fortnite).
If you're using multiple copies of a device on an island, it can be useful to rename them. Choosing names that relate to a device's purpose makes it easier to remember what each one does, and easier to find a specific device when using the [Event Browser](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/event-browser-in-fortnite-creative).
##  Contextual Filtering
Some devices are affected by a feature called contextual filtering. This feature hides or displays options depending on the values selected for certain related options. This feature will reduce clutter in the Customize panel and make options easier to manage and navigate.
However, it may not be easy to recognize which options or values trigger contextual filtering. To help you identify them, in our device docs we use _italic_ for any values that trigger contextual filtering. All options will be listed, including those affected by contextual filtering; if they are hidden or displayed based on a specific option's value, there will be a note about that in the Description field for that option.
##  Device Options
This device has some basic functionality, like boost [regen](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#regen) and whether the radio is [enabled](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#enable). Additionally, there are some advanced options, like whether the sedan vehicle takes damage from [collisions](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary), how much damage it can take before being destroyed, and how much damage it deals when it explodes.

##  Channels
When one device needs to "talk" to another device, it does so by [transmitting](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) a [signal](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) on a specific [channel](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary). The receiving device needs to be set up to [receive](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#receive) the signal on the same channel.
A channel is identified by a number, and channel numbers are customized for a device under the option that uses the channel. Most devices will also pass the identity of the player who [triggered](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) the device with the signal.
When the Sedan Spawner device receives a signal on a channel, it can be enabled or disabled, can spawn or destroy a vehicle, and assign a driver. It can transmit a signal on a channel when a player enters or exits the vehicle, and when the vehicle is spawned or destroyed.
###  Receivers
