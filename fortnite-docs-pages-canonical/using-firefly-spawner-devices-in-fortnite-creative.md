The **Firefly Spawner** device places collectible fireflies that can be used to cause fire destruction. Fireflies spawned from this device will circle around the spawn area until collected.
You can control both the total number of fireflies produced and the duration between spawns. Once collected, these fireflies will be placed in jars that can be equipped in stacks of six in your Equipment Bar.
[![Thrown Jar](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/902f5102-cd9c-4f37-abe1-cbf0a8ff2795?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/902f5102-cd9c-4f37-abe1-cbf0a8ff2795?resizing_type=fit)
Thrown firefly jars will cause any surrounding terrain and structures to take fire damage if **Enable Fire** , **Environment Damage** , and **Structure Damage** are enabled in [My Island Settings](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary).
Players directly hit with a firefly jar will take 40 points of damage. Stepping into fire from this device will take 15 points of health per second. Both the affected player and their health bar will be in flames.
To find the Firefly Spawner device, see [Using Devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-devices-in-fortnite).
If you're using multiple copies of a device on an island, it can be helpful to [rename](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) them. You can choose names that relate to each device's purpose, so it's easier to remember what each one does.
