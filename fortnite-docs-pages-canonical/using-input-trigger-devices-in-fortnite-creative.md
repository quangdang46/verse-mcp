# Input Trigger Devices
Learn how to trigger events with player input or by activating with other devices.
![Input Trigger Devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/f5a411ae-c7e0-4c85-98b2-3ea97bcf4f7f?resizing_type=fill&width=1920&height=335)
The **Input Trigger** device is a way to trigger events when players press or release a particular control input. You can use the device to capture when an input is pressed, and which player pressed it.
Response time for input defined in the input trigger device is dependent on the round-trip time between the player's client and the server. Because of this, input can take up to a second depending on the player's internet connection, so keep this in mind when using the input trigger device for your game.
You can use [event binding](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#direct-event-binding) in the Creative toolset, connections in the **Details** panel in UEFN, or Verse code, to trigger other device functions such as blowing up a barrel, changing cameras, or other gameplay that is triggerable.
For help finding the Input Trigger device, see **[Using Devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-devices-in-fortnite)**.
If you're using multiple copies of a device on an island, it can be helpful to [rename](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#rename-a-device) them. Choosing names that relate to a device's purpose makes it easier to remember what each one does, and easier to find a specific device when using the **[Event Browser](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/event-browser-in-fortnite-creative)**.
##  How the Creative Input Option Works
When you customize the Input Trigger device options, you'll see the **Creative Input** option listed first. This option's values correspond to a number of new input actions that can be configured by players. The way this works is a little complicated, so this section provides a more detailed explanation than the Device Options table has room for.
Players can find and rebind these inputs in the **Creative Input Action** section of the **Keyboard Controls** and **Controller Mapping** tabs in the Settings Menu.
Open the **sidebar** , click the **gear** icon to open the **Setting Menu** , then click either the **Keyboard Controls** or the **Controller Mapping** icons. You can find the **Creative Input Action** section of the settings by scrolling down the list in the left navigation area. This is where players can change which actions map to which controls. These settings apply across all of your Fortnite experiences.
For people on mobile platforms, these inputs always appear as new buttons displayed on the screen. The Input Trigger device has options you can use to customize the icon and color of this button, and whether you want it to display text.
##  Contextual Filtering
Some devices are affected by a feature called **contextual filtering**. This feature hides or displays options depending on the values selected for certain related options. This reduces clutter in the Customize panel and makes options easier to manage and navigate. To help identify them, values that trigger contextual filtering are in _italic_.
All options are listed, including those affected by contextual filtering; if they are hidden or displayed based on a specific option's value, there will be a note about it in the Description field for that option.
##  Device Options
Default values are **bold**. Values that trigger contextual filtering are _italic_.
You can configure this device with the following options.
Option  |  Value  |  Description
---|---|---
**Input Type** |  **Creative Input Action** , _Standard Action_ |  Determines if this device tracks a standard input or a custom input. Standard inputs are used for common game actions. If **Standard Actions** is set as the Input Type, this device will listen for whether inputs bound to those actions are pressed or released. **Creative Input Actions** are custom actions only used by the Input Trigger.
**Creative Input** |  Custom 1 (Fire), Custom 2 (Target), Custom 3 (Crouch), Custom 4 (Jump), Custom 5 (Sprint), **Custom 6 (Interact)** , _Custom 7 (Forward/Back)_ , _Custom 8 (Left/Right)_ , Custom 9 (Previous Item), Custom 10 (Next Item), Custom 11 (Swap Quickbar), Custom 12 (Harvesting Tool) |  If the **Input Type** option is set to **Creative Input Actions** , this defines the input control this device is listening for. For more information about how this works, see the **How the Creative Input Option Works** section above. If you select **Custom 7** or **Custom 8** , an additional option is displayed below.
**Axis Direction** |  Negative, **Any** , Positive |  This option only displays if the Creative Input option is set to **Custom 7** or **Custom 8**. If the input control selected in the **Creative Input** option is a directional axis, this determines which direction the device is listening for. **Negative** is left or backwards, **Positive** is right or forwards.
**Standard Input** |  **Fire** , Target, Crouch, Sprint, Jump |  This option only displays if the **Input Type** is set to **Standard Action**. These are inputs are the same ones bound to normal player actions. This device only listens for whether these inputs are pressed or released. In cases where a mobile device doesn't have these inputs, a custom button is created.
**Consume Input** |  On, **Off** |  If set to **On** , this stops the input being read by other actions bound to that input.
**Show on HUD** |  **On** , Off |  Determines if the input is shown on the HUD.
**HUD Description** |  **{input}** , Enter text |  If **Show on HUD** is set to **On** , this is the text that will show on the HUD. The text field has a character limit of 24. The default text **{input}** will show the current input.
**Enabled At Game Start** |  **On** , Off |  Determines if the device is enabled when the game starts.
**Selected Team** |  **Any** , Pick a team |  Determines which team can activate the input.
**Selected Class** |  No Class, **Any** , Pick a class |  Determines which classes can activate the input.
**Invert Team Selection** |  On, **Off** |  If this is set to **On** , the input can be activated by all teams except the one chosen in the **Selected Team** option.
**Invert Class Selection** |  On, **Off** |  If this is set to **On** , the input can be activated by all classes except the one chosen in the **Selected Class** option.
**Registered Player Behavior** |  **Add Registered** , Require Registered, Ignore Registered |  Determines how registered players are counted by the device.
  * **Add Registered** : Players can either be registered or counted by the device.
  * **Require Registered** : Players must be both registered and counted by the device.
  * **Ignore Registered** : Players must be counted, but not registered by the device.
