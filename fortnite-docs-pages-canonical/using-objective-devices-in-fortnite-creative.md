On this page
The **Objective Device** provides a collection of destructible devices that you can select from to use as [objectives](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#objective) in your game.
You can also control various features like how many [health points](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#hp) (HP) a device has, and how many points the player gets for destroying it.
An Objective device has optional [particle effects](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#particle-effect) and a [HUD marker](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#hud-marker) that displays its state. It also can provide [HUD messages](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) to all players as it takes damage.
If the **Objectives to End** option under **Island Settings > Round > End Condition** is set to **1** , the player or team that destroys the Objective device will win the game.
For information on finding devices, see [](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-devices-in-fortnite-creative)**[Using Devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-devices-in-fortnite)**.
##  Contextual Filtering 
Some devices are affected by a feature called **contextual filtering**. This feature hides or displays options depending on the values selected for certain related options. This feature will reduce clutter in the Customize panel and make options easier to manage and navigate.
However, it may not be easy to recognize which options or values trigger contextual filtering. To help you identify them, in our device docs we use _italic_ for any values that trigger contextual filtering. All options will be listed, including those affected by contextual filtering; if they are hidden or displayed based on a specific option's value, there will be a note about that in the Description field for that option.
##  Device Options 
Each device in the gallery has a default value of 100 HP, is set as an objective for all players, and uses a HUD marker for any player who gets within 5 tiles (25.6 meters) of it.
You can configure this device with the following options.
Default values are **bold**. Values that trigger contextual filtering are _italic_.
