# Rift Point Volume Devices
Use the Rift Point Volume device to use a bomb similar to the one used in Ballistic.

The Rift Point Volume is a large-detonation bomb that can be planted, defused and detonated in various locations around your island. **You need to use the Rift Point Device item along with this device** , as players need that item to plant the bomb.
Place the Rift Point Volume at the point where you want players to plant the bomb. Then decide on how you want the players to acquire or receive the Rift Point Device item--through event binding, an Item Granter, or some other way. During the game, the Rift Point Device item will look like the image below when they have it in their player inventory.

When the player approaches the area defined by the Rift Point Volume, they will see the Hotkey menu pop up with the control for planting the Rift Point, as shown in the image below.

For help on how to find the **Rift Point Volume** device, see [Using Devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-devices-in-fortnite).
If you're using multiple copies of a device on an island, it can be useful to [rename](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/rename-a-device) them. Choosing names that relate to a device's purpose makes it easier to remember what each one does, and easier to find a specific device when using the [Event Browser](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/event-browser-in-fortnite-creative).
##  Contextual Filtering
Some devices are affected by a feature called **contextual filtering**. This feature hides or displays options depending on the values selected for certain related options. This feature will reduce clutter in the **Customize** panel and make options easier to manage and navigate.
However, it may not be easy to recognize which options or values trigger contextual filtering. To help you identify them, in our device docs we use  _italic_ for any values that trigger contextual filtering. All options will be listed, including those affected by contextual filtering; if they are hidden or displayed based on a specific option’s value, there will be a note about that in the Description field for that option.
###  Device Options
