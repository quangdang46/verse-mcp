**Earth Sprites** are fun interactive beings you can place all over your island, just like the Earth Sprites in Battle Royale CH6S1. Players can interact with the Earth Sprite, and exchange gear for new loot. You can register items, weapons, and other loot onto this device to customize the loot it provides to players. By default, it provides the same loot as the Battle Royale version.
For help with finding the **Earth Sprite** device, see [Using Devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-devices-in-fortnite).
If you're using multiple copies of a device on an island, it can be useful to [rename](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/rename-a-device) them. Choosing names that relate to a device's purpose makes it easier to remember what each one does, and easier to find a specific device when using the [Event Browser](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/event-browser-in-fortnite-creative).
