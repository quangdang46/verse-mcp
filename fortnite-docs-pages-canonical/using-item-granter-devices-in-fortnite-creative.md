# Item Granter Devices
Use this device to grant items to a player during the game.
![Item Granter Devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/e4821fc2-0687-4788-8d32-63ff499b5a7e?resizing_type=fill&width=1920&height=335)
The **Item Granter** device can automatically place items into player inventories during your game, or you can set conditions for manually placing items in player inventories.
You can determine what items are granted and when, and set other conditions by configuring the device using the options listed below. You can set whether to send an item to a player's inventory, or drop it near a player in-game. You can also use other devices to trigger the Item Granter.
To register items with the Item Granter, follow these steps.
  1. In the Creative inventory, use the Weapons and Items tabs to find the items you want to register with the Item Granter. Click **EQUIP** to put them in your Player inventory.
  2. Stand directly beside the Item Granter.
  3. Press the **Tab** key to open the Creative inventory screen, then click **PLAY** to switch to the Player inventory screen.
  4. Click the desired item, then press either **Z** or **X** to split or drop the item. You can also drag the item to the side until a [backpack icon](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#backpack-icon) appears.

When an item is registered with the Item Granter using the steps above, a hologram of the registered item will float above the device.
Like the [Item Spawner](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-item-spawner-devices-in-fortnite-creative), this device is the recommended method of delivering [items](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-items-in-fortnite-creative) and weapons to players in game.
The difference between the Item Spawner and the Item Granter is that the Item Spawner creates the [registered](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#register) item and drops it into the game world for players to pick up while the Item Granter automatically places the registered devices into the player's inventory.

To find the Item Granter device, go to the Creative inventory and select the Devices tab. From there you can search or browse for the device. For more information on finding devices see [Using Devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-devices-in-fortnite).
If you're using multiple copies of a device on an island, it can be helpful to [rename](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#rename-a-device) them. You can choose names that relate to each device’s purpose, so it’s easier to remember what each one does.
##  Device Options
The Item Granter has some basic functionality, like what item to grant to players, what to do with a player's existing inventory when granting an item, and whether to give a player extra ammo if the player is given a weapon. Additionally, there are some advanced options, like setting conditions for when a player is granted an item, if players from certain teams get different items, and how the items in the device are cycled.
###  Contextual Filtering
Some devices are affected by a feature called **contextual filtering**. This feature hides or displays options depending on the values selected for certain related options. This reduces clutter in the Customize panel and makes options easier to manage and navigate. To help identify them, values that trigger contextual filtering are in _italic_.
All options are listed, including those affected by contextual filtering; if they are hidden or displayed based on a specific option's value, there will be a note about it in the Description field for that option.
