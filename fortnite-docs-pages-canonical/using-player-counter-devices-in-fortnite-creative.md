# Player Counter Devices
Use to find out how many players are in a certain area of your island.
![Player Counter Devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/d3f5a4e3-a9c4-43a0-8ad6-f4f918504125?resizing_type=fill&width=1920&height=335)
Using the **Player Counter** , you can find out how many players of a certain team or [class](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#class) are in the game, or how many are in a specific area. The device can send [signals](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) based on that count. Some examples of how you can use this device include:
  * Balancing teams if a lot of players leave at one time.
  * Creating areas on your island that require a certain amount of players (such as for a [minigame](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#mini-game)).
  * Creating events that only start if the required number of players are present.

To find the Player Counter device, see [](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-devices-in-fortnite-creative)**[Using Devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-devices-in-fortnite)**.
If you're using multiple copies of a device on an island, it can be helpful to [rename](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#rename-a-device) them. Choosing names that relate to a device's purpose makes it easier to remember what each one does, and easier to find a specific device when using the [Event Browser](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/event-browser-in-fortnite-creative).
##  Contextual Filtering
Some devices are affected by a feature called **contextual filtering**. This feature hides or displays options depending on the values selected for certain related options. This reduces clutter in the Customize panel and makes options easier to manage and navigate. To help identify them, values that trigger contextual filtering are in _italic_.
All options are listed, including those affected by contextual filtering; if they are hidden or displayed based on a specific option's value, there will be a note about it in the Description field for that option.
##  Device Options
This device has some basic functionality, like setting a target value, and criteria for comparisons. Additionally, there are some advanced options, like determining when the count comparison occurs, which team or class is counted, and whether the device transmits when the comparison happens.
You can configure this device with the following options.
Default values are **bold**. Values that trigger contextual filtering are _italic_.

##  Direct Event Binding
Direct event binding allows devices to communicate directly, which makes your workflow more intuitive, and gives you more freedom to focus on your design ideas.
Below are the following direct event binding options for this device.
###  Functions
A [function](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) listens for an event on a device then performs an action.
  1. For any function, click the **option** , then **Select Device** to access and select from the **Device dropdown menu**.
  2. Once you've selected a device, click **Select Event** and select the event that triggers this function.
  3. If more than one device or event triggers a function, press the **Add** button to add a line and repeat these steps.

Option  |  Description
---|---
**Compare Players to Target When Receiving From** |  This function compares the player count to the target number when an event occurs, and triggers either the **On Count Succeed** or the **On Count Fail** events.
**Enable When Receiving From** |  This function enables the device when an event occurs.
**Disable When Receiving From** |  This function disables the device when an event occurs.
**Transmit for All Counted Players When Receiving From** |  When an event occurs, this function sends the **On Player Counted** event for every player currently counted. This will override the setting for the **Transmit On Player Counted/Removed** function, and will always send a signal for every player currently counted.
**Increment Target Player Count When Receiving From** |  When an event occurs, this function increases the Target Player Count number by 1. This immediately triggers a new comparison.
**Decrement Target Player Count When Receiving From** |  When an event occurs, this function reduces the Target Player Count number by 1. This immediately triggers a new comparison.
**Reset Target Player Count When Receiving From** |  When an event occurs, this function returns the Target Player Count to its original number. If the Target Player Count was previously increased or decreased, this reset immediately triggers a new comparison.
**Register Player When Receiving From** |  This function registers the instigating player when an event occurs. Registered players may be added or removed from the set of Counted players depending on the value set for the **Count Registered Players** option.
**Unregister Player When Receiving From** |  This function unregisters the instigating player when an event occurs. Unregistered players may be added or removed from the set of Counted players depending on the value set for the **Count Registered Players** option.
**Unregister All Players When Receiving From** |  This function clears all players from the registered list. Unregistered players may be added or removed from the set of Counted players depending on the value set for the **Count Registered Players** option.
###  Events
Direct event binding uses events as transmitters. An event tells another device to perform a function.
  1. For any event option, click the **option** , then **Select Device** to access and select from the **Device dropdown menu**.
  2. Once you've selected a device, click **Select Function** to bind the event to a function for that device.
  3. If more than one function is triggered by the event, press the **Add** button and repeat.

Option  |  Description
---|---
**On Count Succeeds Send Event To** |  If the player count matches the Target Player Count number, an event is sent to the selected device.
**On Count Fails Send Event To** |  If the player count does not match the Target Player Count number, an event is sent to the selected device.
**On Player Counted Send Event To** |  If a valid player enters the zone and is counted, an event is sent to the selected device. It uses the rule in the value for the **Transmit On Player Counted/Removed** option, unless this event is triggered by the **Transmit for All Counted Players When Receiving From** function.
**On Player Removed Send Event To** |  When a player is no longer counted by this device (such as when they leave the zone, leave the game, or are assigned to a different Team or Class), an event is sent to the selected device.
