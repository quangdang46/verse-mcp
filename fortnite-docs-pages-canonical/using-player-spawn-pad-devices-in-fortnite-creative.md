# Player Spawner Devices
Use Player Spawn Pad Devices to spawn players onto your island.
![Player Spawner Devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/eed2e11a-e865-4f73-907a-67c6898ae017?resizing_type=fill&width=1920&height=335)
The **Player Spawn Pad** spawns the player at any location on their island.
This device can only spawn one player. You will need to place individual spawners for islands with multiple players. Otherwise, they will always fall from the sky and have to parachute down.
For help on how to find the **Player Spawner** device, see [](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-devices-in-fortnite-creative)**[Using Devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-devices-in-fortnite)**.
If you're using multiple copies of a device on an island, it can be helpful to [rename](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#rename-a-device) them. You can choose names that relate to each device's purpose, so it's easier to remember what each one does.
