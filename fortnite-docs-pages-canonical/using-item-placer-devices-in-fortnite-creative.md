# Item Placer Devices
Place weapons or items in a more realistic way, such as sitting on a table or hanging on a wall.

The **Item Placer** device gives you a way to place weapons or [item](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) items in locations that are more realistic, as opposed to [Item Spawners](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#item-spawner) or chests that just drop items and weapons on the ground. You can drop an item or weapon onto the Item Placer to register it. The device acts as a container, but is shaped like the item registered. When a player interacts with the device, it grants the registered item to that player. If the device is mounted on a destructible object and that object is destroyed, the registered item drops to the ground. Destructible objects can include [props](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#prop), building pieces, and terrain, depending on the settings you have modified in [My Island](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) or in other devices.
To find the Item Placer device in Creative, see [**Using Devices**](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-devices-in-fortnite-creative). To find the Item Placer in UEFN, open the Content Drawer and click **Fortnite > Devices > Item**.
If you're using multiple copies of a device on an island, it can be helpful to [rename](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#rename-a-device) them. Choosing names that relate to a device's purpose makes it easier to remember what each one does, and easier to find a specific device when using the [Event Browser](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/event-browser-in-fortnite-creative).
##  Contextual Filtering
Some devices are affected by a feature called **contextual filtering**. This feature hides or displays options depending on the values selected for certain related options. This reduces clutter in the Customize panel and makes options easier to manage and navigate. To help identify them, values that trigger contextual filtering are in _italic_.
All options are listed, including those affected by contextual filtering; if they are hidden or displayed based on a specific option's value, there will be a note about it in the Description field for that option.
##  Device Options
This device has some basic functionality, like setting the interaction time and which teams or [classes](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#class) can interact with the device. Additionally, there are some advanced options, like inverting the class or team selection and determining whether the device is enabled when the game starts.
