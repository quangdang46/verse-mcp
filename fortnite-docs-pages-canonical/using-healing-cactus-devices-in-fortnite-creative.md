# Healing Cactus Devices
Place this cactus in your island environment to provide an additional source of healing for players.

The **Healing Cactus** is full of Healing Fruit, and can be found spread around a desert environment. Players can hit a cactus to "burst" the cactus fruit, which heals players that are near the cactus. After a period of time, the cactus springs back up from the ground and can be used again.
Players can interact with these cacti even when in a vehicle – they can shoot the cactus or hit it with their vehicle to trigger the healing effect. Here are some examples of how you can use this device:
  * You want to include healing plants on your island but it is a desert environment, and the other healing plants don't fit with the biome.
  * Loot containers are limited or not used on your island, and you want to offer a novel method for players to get healing.
  * You want to give players a healing option but want something that has a built-in limit (the cactus needs time to respawn its fruit).

For help on how to find the **Healing Cactus** device, see [Using Devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-devices-in-fortnite).
If you're using multiple copies of a device on an island, it can be useful to [rename](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#rename-a-device) them. Choosing names that relate to a device's purpose makes it easier to remember what each one does, and easier to find a specific device when using the **[Event Browser](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/event-browser-in-fortnite-creative)**.
##  Contextual Filtering
Some devices are affected by a feature called **contextual filtering**. This feature hides or displays options depending on the values selected for certain related options. This reduces clutter in the Customize panel and makes options easier to manage and navigate. To help identify them, values that trigger contextual filtering are in _italic_.
All options are listed, including those affected by contextual filtering; if they are hidden or displayed based on a specific option's value, there will be a note about it in the Description field for that option.
##  Device Options
Default values are **bold**. Values that trigger contextual filtering are _italic_.
