The **Outliner panel** , or **Outliner** for short, displays all [actors](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/unreal-editor-for-fortnite-glossary#actor) within a scene in a hierarchical view. You can save time when working in **Unreal Editor for Fortnite (UEFN)** by using the Outliner shortcuts below.
##  Make Copies
Creating landscapes or building structures can be monotonous work, especiallly if you're dragging the same [prop](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/unreal-editor-for-fortnite-glossary#prop) over and over from the [Content Drawer](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/unreal-editor-for-fortnite-glossary#content-drawer). Instead, use the following workflow to increase your productivity.

  1. Create a group of props by selecting and dragging two or more props from the **Content Drawer** at the same time. They will appear in the [viewport](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/unreal-editor-for-fortnite-glossary#viewport), and also appear in the Outliner panel.
  2. Press and hold **Shift** while selecting props from the Outliner. A gold outline appears around a selected prop in the viewport.
  3. Press **Ctrl + C** to copy the selected props, and **Ctrl + V** to paste them.

  5. Repeat these steps to create large buildings or expansive landscapes.

Another quick way to copy props is to press and hold **Alt** while [translating](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/unreal-editor-for-fortnite-glossary#translate) the props you have selected in the viewport.
