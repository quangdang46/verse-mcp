# RR Vehicle Spawner Devices
Customize this vehicle to use the same game mechanics as Rocket Racing, but on your own island.
![RR Vehicle Spawner Devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/ba59b8bf-5572-4a27-81f4-968d689768bf?resizing_type=fill&width=1920&height=335)
The **RR Vehicle Spawner** is a device that [spawns](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#spawning) a vehicle with Rocket Racing (RR) features. Drive it full throttle down a track, or freestyle across dunes, up hills, and through the air with a boost!
This vehicle has more mobility than most vehicles in Fortnite Creative, and can be customized more than other Fortnite Creative vehicles.
The RR vehicle has sticky wheels that a player can use to drive up vertical surfaces and even upside down on ceilings and ceiling-like surfaces. It does not use fuel or carry passengers.
The RR Vehicle Spawner device is a great starting point if you want to create your own racing game. It offers the same mechanics as Rocket Racing, and dozens of options that you can adjust for specific gameplay needs.
Tune back the Rocket Racing mechanics to create a more grounded driving experience, or crank it up to 11 and create a more platformer-centric racing game with greater aerial control than even Rocket Racing!
For help on how to find the **RR Vehicle Spawner** device, see [**Using Devices**](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-devices-in-fortnite-creative).
##  RR Vehicle Controls
Driving an RR vehicle uses the following controls. Understanding these actions will help you work out how to configure the vehicle for your specific gameplay.
  * **Throttle** Moves the vehicle forward.
  * **Brake** Moves the vehicle in reverse.
  * **Steer Left** Turns to the left.
  * **Steer Right** Turns to the right.
  * **Jump** Makes the vehicle jump into the air. Press the **left mouse button**.
  * **Thruster** Like a jump but extended. Press and **hold the left mouse button** to activate the thruster.
  * **Turbo** This is the applied boost. Press the **mouse wheel** to engage.
  * **Rocket Drift** When a driver steers sharply into a turn, this can push the rear tires outside of the curve. When the back wheels slide while the driver maintains control of the front wheels, this is called drifting. Press the **Shift** key to drift.
  * **Air Dodge** While airborne, use an air dodge to attach to walls or ceilings by turning the vehicle while pressing the **right mouse button**.
  * **Reverse Camera** This reverses the camera for a rear view. When released, the camera returns to a front view. Press **Q** to reverse the camera, then release to return to the forward camera view.

##  Vehicle Skin Options
Players have full control over their own car [cosmetics](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#cosmetics) through their [lockers](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#locker). Any cosmetics a player is awarded or purchases for Rocket Racing is available in the player's locker. The RR vehicle will spawn with the selected car cosmetics when a player drives the vehicle.
The selected [skin](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#outfit) has no effect on the vehicle's performance.
If you're using multiple copies of a device on an island, it can be useful to [rename](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#rename-a-device) them. Choosing names that relate to a device's purpose makes it easier to remember what each one does, and easier to find a specific device when using the [**Event Browser**](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/event-browser-in-fortnite-creative).
##  Contextual Filtering
Some devices are affected by a feature called contextual filtering. This feature hides or displays options depending on the values selected for certain related options. This feature will reduce clutter in the Customize panel and make options easier to manage and navigate.
However, it may not be easy to recognize which options or values trigger contextual filtering. To help you identify them, in our device docs we use _italic_ for any values that trigger contextual filtering. All options will be listed, including those affected by contextual filtering; if they are hidden or displayed based on a specific option’s value, there will be a note about that in the Description field for that option.
