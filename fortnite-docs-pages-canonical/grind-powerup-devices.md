This can be useful in [brawl games](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) where you can offer a status [buff](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) to increase the [damage](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) they put out, or to boost their speed.
You can also use it in [skillrun](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary)- or [parkour](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary)-type games where you can raise stakes by forcing players to slip on a surface, making the run more challenging.
