![Tracker Device Design Examples](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/b26617e6-15e6-4ad1-ac41-d76ffb4119f9?resizing_type=fill&width=1920&height=335)
The **[Tracker](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-tracker-devices-in-fortnite-creative)** device is intended to track custom [objectives](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite-creative/fortnite-creative-glossary#objective) that a player can complete.
You can track objectives for individual players, a team, or multiple teams, and send a signal to another device when the player completes a tracked objective.
##  Target Practice Tracker
A basic use of the tracker is to track events sent to the device. In this example, you’ll use **target dummies** to send events to a tracker.
###  Devices Used

  * 3 x [Target Dummy](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-target-dummy-devices-in-fortnite-creative) devices

###  Set Up the Devices

###  Bind Functions and Events
[Direct event binding](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite-creative/fortnite-creative-glossary#directeventbinding) is how you set devices to communicate directly with other devices. This involves setting [functions](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite-creative/fortnite-creative-glossary#function) and [events](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite-creative/fortnite-creative-glossary#event) for the devices involved.
Configure the following events on the Target Dummy device.

You know have the basic functionality for target practice using the Tracker device!
###  Design Tip
The Tracker device can be connected to any device that can send events — which is pretty much all of them!
Think of all of the different possible quests that you can give the player with all of the Fortnite Creative devices at your disposal.
##  Build a Timed Escape Room
You can configure the Tracker device to track many different events by default, including the number of chests the player has opened. In this example, you’ll combine this functionality of the tracker with a timer to create a Timed Escape Room experience!
###  Devices Used

  * 1 x Player Spawner device
  * 1 x [Timer ](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-timer-devices-in-fortnite-creative)device
  * 2 x [Lock ](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-lock-devices-in-fortnite-creative)devices

###  Set Up the Escape Room Play Area
  1. Place the **Haunted Homestead** prefab.

  3. Place a **Player Spawner** device near the door.
  4. Customize the device so the player spawner is not visible in-game.

You now have the basic functionality for a system that uses Tracker and Timer devices to create a simple timed objective.
###  Design Tip
Connecting the tracker to a timer is a good way to create a simple and effective game loop. With this combination, you have a goal to complete (an objective with the tracker) and a challenge making it difficult (time limit with the timer). With these building blocks, you can create the foundation of tons of fun games!
##  Build a Farming Mode with the Tracker
The Tracker device is great for setting up quests in role-playing games.
In this example, you’ll use the tracker to track a quest in a farming game. You'll configure the device to work for both single and multiplayer sessions and will save the player’s quest progress in between play sessions.

[![](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/fb20fd82-1697-43d3-819a-4747de9f379a?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/fb20fd82-1697-43d3-819a-4747de9f379a?resizing_type=fit)

  4. Under **Equipment** , change **Environment Damage** to **Off**.

You now have the basic functionality for a farming simulator!
###  Design Tip
Consider how these mechanics could be extended into a full game. Different plots of land could contain different crops, or the player could even be given a choice of what to plant where.
You could also set up a shop where the player could sell their crops for money to buy new upgrades. Completing an objective with the tracker could start a new, more difficult objective, creating an entire questline.
The possibilities are endless!
