Now that most gameplay elements are in place, you need to add the devices which will allow the game to determine the winner of the race.
##  Set Up Checkpoints
Place the **Race Checkpoint** where you would like your race to start and configure the **User Settings** as follows:
Option  |  Value  |  Explanation
---|---|---
**Checkpoint Number** |  1 |  For each checkpoint you add, increment the number by 1.
**Allow Players to Pass without Vehicle** |  False |  This prevents a player from abandoning a vehicle and finishing the race on foot.
**Visible Prior To Race Start** |  No |  Not making the checkpoints visible prior to race start is used by lots of designers, but you can set this to a different value if you want.
**Enabled During Phase** |  Gameplay Only |  Players must wait until the race starts to pass a checkpoint.
When copying the checkpoints to the next locations, you will need to increment the checkpoint numbers by 1 for each additional checkpoint. You will only need to use **Direct Event Binding** on the last checkpoint you place.
##  Add the Score Manager
[![score manager](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/0790110b-f89c-410d-a9ef-694962fb77ba?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/0790110b-f89c-410d-a9ef-694962fb77ba?resizing_type=fit)
Set up a **Score Manager** device to count the points needed to win the round. Since the winner will need to complete three laps to finish the race, place the device and set the following option:
Option  |  Value  |  Explanation
---|---|---
**Score Value** |  1 |  Each checkpoint awards 1 point.
Only the last checkpoint you placed should be bound to this score manager.
##  Add the Race Manager Device
You'll use the **Race Manager** to set how many laps it takes to finish a race, and set the channel for the **Timed Objective** device. By default, this device will also add waypoints and show arrows that point to the next checkpoint unless disabled.
Option  |  Value  |  Explanation
---|---|---
**Number of Laps** |  3 |  One lap is the default. If you change this to more than one, you will need to modify the score in the **IslandSettings** to match the new score required to win. For example, if you want the race to go for two laps, this would require 2 points to win.
**Start Race on Game Start** |  False |  The race will start when a signal is received.
##  Putting it All Together
With all the devices in place, it's time to set up how they interact. Direct event binding allows devices to talk to one another directly by using **events** and **functions**. Learn more about it [here](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/direct-event-binding-in-unreal-editor-for-fortnite).
Device A  |  Function  |  Device B  |  Event  |  Explanation

**Triggers #1 and #2** [![Trigger](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/43fe75d5-1088-47ee-abfa-594eb204a27d?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/43fe75d5-1088-47ee-abfa-594eb204a27d?resizing_type=fit) |  Trigger |  **Pickup Truck Spawners #1 and #2** [![Bear Spawners](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/aae68798-87c0-4033-a4a6-58cc49da5815?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/aae68798-87c0-4033-a4a6-58cc49da5815?resizing_type=fit) |  On Player Exits Vehicle |  The trigger will activate when a player exits their vehicle. Normally you would want to prevent the player from leaving the vehicle, but you want to let the player exit the vehicle if it flips over to give them a few seconds to flip the vehicle back, then force them back into the driver's seat.
