![Ammo Items](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/a5a5c556-9049-484a-b865-253595b59504?resizing_type=fill&width=1920&height=335)
Offer **Ammo** [items](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) for players to restock weapons during gameplay. These ammo variations can supply bullets, shells, rockets, and arrows that projectile weapons consume.
When selecting ammo, you should also offer players a corresponding weapon. The required ammo for each weapon is indicated by an icon, which is shown in the [Using Ammo Items](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-ammo-items-in-fortnite-creative) section below.
For your gameplay, you may want to either automatically grant ammo through the [**Item Granter**](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-item-granter-devices-in-fortnite-creative) or spawn them onto the map for players to find with the [**Item Spawner**](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-item-spawner-devices-in-fortnite-creative).

  4. Click the item, then click either **EQUIP** or **ADD TO CHEST**.

Clicking **Equip** will add the item to your [Resources bar](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#resources-bar). (When you're back in Create mode, you can view items in your Resources bar by pressing the **Tab** key and selecting **Play**.)

You may want to offer an item bundle to players through a [chest](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#chest) or [llama](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#llama). Selecting **Add To Chest** will add the item to the [Chest tab](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary). Each time you click it, the item count will increase by one, shown in a yellow box on the **Chest** tab.
From the **Chest** tab, you can select either **Create Chest** or **Create Llama** to store the items in a Chest or a Llama for use [in-game](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#in-game).
You can add up to fifteen items to the **Chest** tab. When it’s full, the **Add To Chest** tab will disappear. To add more items, you first have to remove items from the **Chest** tab.
##  Managing Items
You can manage these items when you are in [Play inventory](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#play-inventory). To access the **Play** inventory screen, press **Tab** and click **Play** in the top navigation bar. In the PLAY inventory, you can create or split item stacks, or remove them entirely from your Resources bar.
[![Resources Bar](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/e9026e6e-dfac-46d2-947d-23a5afb994ae?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/e9026e6e-dfac-46d2-947d-23a5afb994ae?resizing_type=fit)

Instead of dropping these items on the ground, it's best to grant them to players by using item-granting devices like the Item Spawner.
You cannot reposition or copy items with the phone tool. To delete an item from your inventory in Create mode, you will have to select either _Respawn_ or _Back To Hub_ from the _Menu_. When you do this, your inventory clears.
