# Hiding Prop Gallery Devices
Add these props to your island to give players a place to hide, and use them to create new Hide-and-Seek games.
![Hiding Prop Gallery Devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/0d919984-a1b5-41fb-b36b-2b8e4eb52954?resizing_type=fill&width=1920&height=335)
The **Hiding Prop Gallery** provides you with several different [props](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#prop) that players can hide in and teleport through:
  * **Port-a-Potty**
  * **Haystack**
  * **Garbage Dumpster**
  * **Scarecrow**

You can use these to create a [hide-and-seek](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#hide-and-seek) game that is different from a [prop hunt](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#prop-hunt). You can customize the props so that more than one player can hide in one, and determine whether the prop has sound effects and a wobbling animation when it is occupied.
For help on how to find the **Hiding Prop Gallery** , see **[Using Devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-devices-in-fortnite)**.
If you're using multiple copies of a device on an island, it can be useful to [rename](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#rename-a-device) them. Choosing names that relate to a device's purpose makes it easier to remember what each one does, and easier to find a specific device when using the **[Event Browser](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/event-browser-in-fortnite-creative)**.
##  Device Options
This device has some basic functionality, like choosing which teams and classes can use the hiding prop. Additionally, there are some advanced options, like how many players can hide in a hiding prop and whether they are ejected after a period of time.

##  Using Hiding Prop Gallery in Verse
You can use the code below to control a Hiding Props Gallery device in Verse. This code uses features of the [hiding_prop_device class](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/verse-api/fortnitedotcom/devices/hiding_prop_device) API to enable travel between hiding props, hide players at a set distance, and eject hiding players. You can modify it to fit the needs of your experience.
Verse
```
using { /Fortnite.com/Devices }
using { /Verse.org/Simulation }
using { /UnrealEngine.com/Temporary/Diagnostics }

# See https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/uefn/create-your-own-device-in-verse for how to create a verse device.

# A Verse-authored creative device that can be placed in a level
hiding_prop_example_device := class(creative_device):

    # References to the hiding prop devices in the level

To use this code in your island, follow these steps:
  1. In your UEFN project, drag a **Hiding Props Gallery** device onto your island.
  2. Choose four hiding props to use.
You can duplicate a prop using **Alt + Drag** with the translate tool active.
  3. Create a new Verse device named `hiding_prop_example_device`. To learn how to create a new device in Verse, see [Create Your Own Device Using Verse](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/create-your-own-device-using-verse-in-unreal-editor-for-fortnite).
  4. In the Verse Explorer, double-click `hiding_prop_example_device.verse` to open the script in Visual Studio Code.
  5. Copy and paste in the code above, compile, and drag the device onto your island.
  6. In the **Content Drawer** , search and add 5 Button devices to your island. You can rename the devices to align with the editable property names.
  7. Select your Verse device in the **Outliner**.
  8. In the Verse device's **Details** panel, assign the object references for the hiding props and buttons on your island. You can use the eyedropper to pick the device in the viewport, or use the dropdown and search for the device.
  9. Save your project, and click **Launch Session**.

This example uses print statements to test the functionality of the gameplay setup. This workflow can help ensure your island functions as intended.
