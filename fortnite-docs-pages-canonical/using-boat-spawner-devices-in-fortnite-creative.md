![Boat Spawner Devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/bbd6919c-cf82-4f60-8297-7689c2c569ed?resizing_type=fill&width=1920&height=335)
A **Boat Spawner** is a device you can use to [spawn](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) a motorboat onto an island. You can use Boat Spawner devices in combination with the [Racing Checkpoint Device](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) to design a racing game on the water.
You can place a player directly inside the boat using a [function](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-boat-spawner-devices-in-fortnite-creative#functions).
You can only place a Boat Spawner device on water. You won't be able to place it on dry land, and you can't place it in a Water volume either.
For help on how to find the **Boat Spawner** device, see [Using Devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-devices-in-fortnite).
If you're using multiple copies of a device on an island, it can be useful to [rename](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) them. Choosing names that relate to a device's purpose makes it easier to remember what each one does, and easier to find a specific device when using the [Event Browser](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/event-browser-in-fortnite-creative).
##  Contextual Filtering
Some devices are affected by a feature called **contextual filtering**. This feature hides or displays options depending on the values selected for certain related options. This feature will reduce clutter in the Customize panel and make options easier to manage and navigate.
However, it may not be easy to recognize which options or values trigger contextual filtering. To help you identify them, any values that trigger contextual filtering are in _italic_. All options will be listed, including those affected by contextual filtering; if they are hidden or displayed based on a specific option's value, there will be a note about that in the Description field for that option.
##  Device Options
Default values are **bold**. Values that trigger contextual filtering are _italic_.
