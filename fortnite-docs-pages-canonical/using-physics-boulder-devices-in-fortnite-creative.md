The **Physics Boulder** is a large, rounded boulder that sits on a rocky base. The boulder can be released, and can roll or fall through the environment, depending on where you place it. It is subject to physics and gravity, so it will collide with players, creatures, vehicles, structures, and terrain. You can determine the maximum amount of [damage](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#damage) the falling or rolling boulder does when it hits something (although the actual damage depends on the speed of the boulder on impact).

If you're using multiple copies of a device on an island, it can be useful to [rename](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite-creative/fortnite-creative-glossary#rename-a-device) them. Choosing names that relate to a device's purpose makes it easier to remember what each one does, and easier to find a specific device when using the [Event Browser](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/event-browser-in-fortnite-creative).
