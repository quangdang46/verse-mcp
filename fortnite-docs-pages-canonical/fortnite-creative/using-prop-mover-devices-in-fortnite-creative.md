# Prop Mover Devices
Attach this device to a building piece or terrain prop to create moving platforms, capture areas that move around, complex traversal, or more diverse shooting galleries.
![Prop Mover Devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/092c02b7-96fc-4a6a-8e17-fcab6a94a350?resizing_type=fill&width=1920&height=335)
The **Prop Mover** can be attached to any building piece, terrain piece, or other prop large enough for players to stand on. You can even attach it to devices! The preview sphere will turn green when it is near a prop or device it can attach to.
You can set the movement direction by rotating the Prop Mover device. When paired with other devices, you can expand the uses for this device to create intricate puzzles and traversal problems for players to solve. Here are some examples for how you can use this device:
  * Use a [Button](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-button-devices-in-fortnite-creative), [Conditional Button](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/conditional-button), or [Switch](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-switch-devices-in-fortnite-creative) device to signal the Prop Mover to stop, start, or change direction.
  * Change the **Movement Mode** option to **Rotation** to flip or turn a moving prop so that sometimes it's safe to jump on, and sometimes it isn't safe to jump on.
Use the Prop Mover to rotate the obstacles in the [Fall Guys Obstacle Gallery](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fall-guys-obstacle-course-assets-in-fortnite-creative), to make your Fall Guys obstacle courses better!
  * Place an [Objective](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-objective-devices-in-fortnite-creative) device or [Capture Area](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-capture-area-devices-in-fortnite-creative) device on a moving platform to make protecting these more challenging.
  * Place [Target](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-target-dummy-devices-in-fortnite-creative) devices on moving platforms to create a more sophisticated shooting gallery.
  * Use the Prop Mover to simulate magical or psychic effects like levitation or telekinesis.
  * Recreate your favorite [platformer games](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#platformer), with [collectible objects](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#collectible) placed on top of platforms and stationary props for players to scoop up.
  * Add moving platforms to a [skillrun](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#skillrun) or [adventure](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#adventure) game, to make it even more challenging.

If you're using multiple copies of a device on an island, it can be helpful to [rename](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#rename-a-device) them. Choosing names that relate to a device's purpose makes it easier to remember what each one does, and easier to find a specific device when using the [Event Browser](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/event-browser-in-fortnite-creative).
##  Contextual Filtering in Creative
In Creative, some devices are affected by a feature called **contextual filtering**. This feature hides or displays options depending on the values selected for certain related options. This reduces clutter in the **Customize** panel and makes options easier to manage and navigate. To help identify them, values that trigger contextual filtering are in _italic_.
All options are listed, including those affected by contextual filtering; if they are hidden or displayed based on a specific option's value, there will be a note about it in the **Description** field for that option.

##  Event Binding
Direct event binding allows devices to communicate directly, which makes your workflow more intuitive, and gives you more freedom to focus on your design ideas.
Below are the following direct event binding options for this device.
  1. In Creative, the functions and events are customized in the **Customize** panel (like other device options).
  2. In UEFN, you can find them in the **Details** panel under **User Options - Functions** and **User Options - Events**.

###  Functions
**In Creative** , use the following steps to set a function.
  1. For any function, click the option, then Select Device to access and select from the Device dropdown menu.
  2. Click Select Event to bind the device to an event that will trigger the function for the device.
  3. If more than one device or event triggers a function, click the Add button to add a line and repeat these steps.

**In UEFN** , use the following steps to set a function.
  1. With a device selected, locate the **User Options - Functions** section in the **Details** panel, and expand it.
  2. For any function, click the **+ (plus)** icon to add an array element.
  3. Click the first dropdown, and select a device. If you have a lot of devices, you can use the search bar to find a device more easily.
  4. Click the second dropdown, and select the event you want to bind to this function.

Option  |  Description
---|---
**Enable When Receiving From** |  This function enables the device when an event occurs.
**Disable When Receiving From** |  This function disables the device when an event occurs.
**Start When Receiving From** |  This function starts the prop moving when an event occurs.
**Stop When Receiving From** |  This function interrupts the prop's movement when an event occurs.
**Reset When Receiving From** |  This function resets the device, returning the prop to its original position, when an event occurs.
**Advance When Receiving From** |  When an event occurs, this function advances the prop forward based on the device's default direction, ignoring the prop's previous movement.

###  Events
Direct event binding uses events as transmitters. An event tells another device to perform a function.
Events in UEFN are read-only. They will be set automatically when you set a function on a device that binds to an event on this device.
In Creative, follow these steps to set an event:
  1. For any event option, click the **option** , then **Select Device** to access and select from the **Device dropdown menu**.
  2. Once you've selected a device, click **Select Function** to bind the event to a function for that device.
  3. If more than one function is triggered by the event, press the **Add** button and repeat.
