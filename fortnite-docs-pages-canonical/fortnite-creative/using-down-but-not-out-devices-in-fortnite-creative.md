**Down But Not Out (DBNO)** is a player state where the player does not have full health, but is not yet out of the game. You can use the **Down But Not Out** device to customize the DBNO state to support your game design.
The DBNO state can include the following gameplay elements:
  * A state between **healthy** and **removed from game**.
  * A method for **reviving downed players**.
  * An ability for players to **grab, carry or throw downed players**.
  * A way for a downed player to be [shaken down](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary), with a variety of results.

If you're using multiple copies of a device on an island, it can be helpful to [rename](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) them. You can choose names that relate to each device's purpose, so it's easier to remember what each one does.
##  Contextual Filtering
Some devices are affected by a feature called **contextual filtering**. This feature hides or displays options depending on the values selected for certain related options. This reduces clutter in the Customize panel and makes options easier to manage and navigate. To help identify them, values that trigger contextual filtering are in _italic_.
All options are listed, including those affected by contextual filtering; if they are hidden or displayed based on a specific option's value, there will be a note about it in the Description field for that option.
##  Device Options
This device has some basic functionality, like enabling or disabling the DBNO state, and the rate at which a player's [Tenacity](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) goes down. Additionally, there are some advanced options, like selecting which team or class is affected, and whether players can be shaken down during DBNO.
