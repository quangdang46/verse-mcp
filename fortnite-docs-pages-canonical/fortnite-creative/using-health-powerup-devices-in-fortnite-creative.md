##  Contextual Filtering
Some devices are affected by a feature called **contextual filtering**. This feature hides or displays options depending on the values selected for certain related options. This feature will reduce clutter in the Customize panel and make options easier to manage and navigate.
However, it may not be easy to recognize which options or values trigger contextual filtering. To help you identify them, in our device docs we use _italic_ for any values that trigger contextual filtering. All options will be listed, including those affected by contextual filtering; if they are hidden or displayed based on a specific option's value, there will be a note about that in the Description field for that option.
##  Device Options
You can configure this device with the following options.
Default values are **bold**. Values that trigger contextual filtering are _italic_.
