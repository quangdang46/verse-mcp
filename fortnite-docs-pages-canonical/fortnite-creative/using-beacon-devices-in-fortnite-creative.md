# Beacon Devices
Use the Beacon device to display a visual effect or a HUD Marker (or both!) at a specific location.
![Beacon Devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/7059ae00-e7cc-44c3-af4a-ee23e44618e6?resizing_type=fill&width=1920&height=335)
The **beacon** provides several types of beacons that can use different particle effects in different colors. They can all be used to mark a location in the world, either with the particle effect or a HUD marker.
In **Beacon** mode, the beacon will show one of several particle effects in one of several colors. In **Badge** mode, it will show a HUD Marker with multiple customization options for the color and text shown. The text shown can be different based on the team relationship with the local client.
To find the **Beacon** device, see [Using Devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-devices-in-fortnite).
If you're using multiple copies of a device on an island, it can be helpful to [rename](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) them. Choosing names that relate to a device's purpose makes it easier to remember what each one does, and easier to find a specific device when using the [Event Browser](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/event-browser-in-fortnite-creative).
##  Contextual Filtering
Some devices are affected by a feature called **contextual filtering**. This feature hides or displays options depending on the values selected for certain related options. This reduces clutter in the Customize panel and makes options easier to manage and navigate. To help identify them, values that trigger contextual filtering are in _italic_.
All options are listed, including those affected by contextual filtering; if they are hidden or displayed based on a specific option's value, there will be a note about it in the Description field for that option.
##  Device Options
The device can either show a beacon in the world view, a badge in the HUD, or both. It can be configured with a variety of particle effects and text, depending on the team of players viewing it.
In its default state the beacon shows one of several particle effects, depending on which beacon is chosen.
You can configure this device with the following options.
