# Team Settings and Inventory Devices
Use this device to customize the settings and starting inventory for one or more teams.
![Team Settings and Inventory Devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/7751fc96-ffe6-4edc-b9db-9b677e6a6dc9?resizing_type=fill&width=1920&height=335)
The **Team Settings and Inventory** device is important for most team-based games. It provides team and inventory configurations that go beyond the choices the [Island Settings](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/understanding-island-settings-in-fortnite-creative) give you. You can also use this to customize individual devices, and create variations in team setup.
There is a hierarchy of setting overrides, described as follows:
  * Island Settings are the baseline.
  * Team Settings & Inventory overrides Island Settings if there is a specific value set in the device.
  * Class Designer overrides both Team Settings & Inventory and Island Settings, if there is a specific value set in the device that differs from the Island Settings or Team Settings & Inventory values.

To find the Team Settings & Inventory device, go to the Creative inventory and select the Devices tab. From there you can search or browse for the device. For more information on finding devices see [Finding and Placing Devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-devices-in-fortnite).
If you're using multiple copies of a device on an island, it can be helpful to [rename](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#rename-a-device) them. You can choose names that relate to each device's purpose, so it's easier to remember what each one does.
##  Contextual Filtering
Some devices are affected by a feature called contextual filtering. This feature hides or displays options depending on the values selected for certain related options. This feature will reduce clutter in the Customize panel and make options easier to manage and navigate.
However, it may not be easy to recognize which options or values trigger contextual filtering. To help you identify them, in our device docs we use _italic_ for any values that trigger contextual filtering. All options will be listed, including those affected by contextual filtering; if they are hidden or displayed based on a specific option's value, there will be a note about that in the **Description** field for that option.
##  Device Options
When this device is placed, the device uses settings inherited from the Island Settings in its default state. Because of this, it has no effect on the game until you customize it.
This device has some basic functionality, like setting max [health](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#health) and max [shields](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#shield), as well as setting a spawn limit. Additionally, there are some advanced options, like how much [resource](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#resource) or [score](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#score) a player is granted when they eliminate another player.
