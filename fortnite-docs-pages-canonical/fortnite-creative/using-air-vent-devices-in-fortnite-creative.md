# Air Vent Devices
This device boosts players up into the air.
![Air Vent Devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/0c7eef59-e587-469f-9454-27c78a1e06db?resizing_type=fill&width=1920&height=335)
An **air vent** is primarily used as a method of moving characters in game modes. By standing on it, players are projected upward by the gust of air coming from the vent. It can also knock other objects (such as vehicles, balls, or projectiles) up into the air. If the air vent is placed on a wall, it will knock players or objects in the direction the gust blows.
To find the **Air Vent** device, see [Using Devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-devices-in-fortnite).
The geothermal variants of the Air Vent have been moved to the **Galleries** category in the Creative inventory, and can be found in the **Geothermal Vent Gallery**. These geothermal vents are props and not devices, so they cannot be customized.

If you're using multiple copies of a device on an island, it can be helpful to [rename](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) them. Choosing names that relate to a device's purpose makes it easier to remember what each one does, and easier to find a specific device when using the [Event Browser](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/event-browser-in-fortnite-creative).
