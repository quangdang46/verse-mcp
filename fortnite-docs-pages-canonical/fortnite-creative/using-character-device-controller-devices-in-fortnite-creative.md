**Character Device Controllers** can change a group of [Character devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) to use the same [outfits](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary), have matching poses and animations, and have identical [emotes](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary). Use the same slot settings for multiple [Character devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-character-devices-in-fortnite-creative), then associate that slot on the Character Device Controller. Each Character Device Controller can control a different group, so you can create multiple groups of Character devices, with each group looking or acting differently from the other groups.
You can also use multiple Character Device Controllers with one Character device if you want the character to look different or perform different emotes in response to events in the game.
For help finding the Character Device Controller device, see [Using Devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite-creative/using-devices-in-fortnite-creative).
