# Signal Remote Manager Devices
Give your players the ability to send signals to devices on your island and make things happen!
![Signal Remote Manager Devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/2a0bc3fd-fb40-4e39-8d68-386443804ad1?resizing_type=fill&width=1920&height=335)
A **Signal Remote** is a device players can carry and use to send signals to other devices. You can use the **Signal Remote Manager** to manage how and where these signals are sent. This gives players the ability to send signals from held items [in-game](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary).
For example, a player can activate their Signal Remote to send a signal that teleports them back to their base area.

##  Design Examples
Here are some examples of how you can use the Signal Remote Manager.
  * [Door Lock](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-signal-remote-manager-devices-in-fortnite-creative)
  * [Restock Remote](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-signal-remote-manager-devices-in-fortnite-creative)
  * [Remote Hacking](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-signal-remote-manager-devices-in-fortnite-creative)

The Signal Remote Manager device requires one of the Signal Remote A through D weapons to be registered to it in order to transmit signals correctly. This means you can have four different Signal Remote Manager devices within the same map, one per Signal Remote weapon. Then, through either a Class Manager, Item Spawner or Item Granter, you need to give this to the player to use.
For these examples, all three use the Class Designer device. Place a Class Designer anywhere on the map and customize it with the following settings.
[![Class Designer Settings](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/9974f58f-4eee-4e38-8dd6-d5e653c5ca13?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/9974f58f-4eee-4e38-8dd6-d5e653c5ca13?resizing_type=fit)
Option  |  Value  |  Description
---|---|---
**Class Identifier** |  1 |  This will be used as the default class for all examples.
**Equip Granted Item** |  First Item |  The Signal Remote will be automatically equipped upon spawning.
Next, go to the Game tab in your My Island settings and make sure to set the Default Class Identifier as follows. This will ensure that you spawn with the Signal Remote weapon at the beginning of each design example.
[![My Island Game Tab, Default Class Identifier](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/db4ba5c4-e457-488e-b6fb-64ceb4e09188?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/db4ba5c4-e457-488e-b6fb-64ceb4e09188?resizing_type=fit) My Island Game Tab, Default Class Identifier

###  Door Lock
The most basic functionality of the Signal Remote Manager device is in sending two signals — such as one to open or unlock a door, and the other to close it. This is demonstrated in the following example and video.
You will need the following devices.
  * 1 x **Signal Remote Manager** and **Signal Remote** weapon
  * 1 x [Lock](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-lock-devices-in-fortnite-creative)

  1. Create a wall with a door, and add the Lock device adjacent to the door. Customize the lock to the following settings.
[![Lock Settings](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/26aa3793-bd7f-4e12-b95b-3aa0cd64cbf5?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/26aa3793-bd7f-4e12-b95b-3aa0cd64cbf5?resizing_type=fit)

---|---|---
**Cooldown Time** |  1 Second |  Time between transmitting signals on the Signal Remote.
**On Primary Activation Transmit On** |  Channel 1 |  Transmits the signal to unlock and open the door on primary fire of the Signal Remote.
**On Secondary Fire Transmit On** |  Channel 2 |  Transmits the signal to lock and close the door on secondary fire of the Signal Remote.

You now have a lockable door operated by a Signal Remote weapon.
You can also use this game mechanic for enabling and disabling other devices. Lock a car remotely so nobody else can use it. Make walls vanish and reappear with a toggle for an advanced line of defense. These openings can be used as shortcuts on the team, and restricted to certain classes or globally used.
###  Restock Remote
You can use Signal Manager devices to set primary and secondary fire to trigger Teleporter devices. This gives players a way to restock immediately during a firefight without being eliminated, and provides a way to teleport to a central location..
You will need the following devices.
  * 1 x **Signal Remote Manager** and **Signal Remote**
  * 2 x [Teleporter](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-teleporter-devices-in-fortnite-creative)
  * Multiple [Vending Machines](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-vending-machine-devices-in-fortnite-creative)

  1. Create a resupply depot and a secure place to teleport near the front lines of your arena. Place a Teleporter device inside the resupply depot. Customize it to the following settings.
[![Teleporter Settings](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/0534af11-927f-4565-a857-c5b677f3d846?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/0534af11-927f-4565-a857-c5b677f3d846?resizing_type=fit)

**Teleport To When Receiving From** |  Channel 2 |  Teleports the player when using the alternate fire of the Signal Remote.
  2. Copy the teleporter, and place a second one down in the secure front lines section of your arena. Adjust only the following setting.
[![Teleporter Settings](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/22040f29-ffa3-4124-9d09-efad1166af30?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/22040f29-ffa3-4124-9d09-efad1166af30?resizing_type=fit)
Option  |  Value  |  Description
---|---|---
**Teleport To When Receiving From** |  Channel 1 |  Teleports the player when using the primary fire of the Signal Remote.
  3. Populate the resupply depot with the vending machines and equipment you want, using the default device settings.

You now have a Signal Remote weapon able to teleport the player between two different locations.
Game modes with longer respawns or limited lives can benefit from this method of re-engagement, where running in and being eliminated might not be the best way to get back in the fight. There can also be two assault points that a player can choose between after respawning.
###  Remote Hacking
You can use more complex interactions with a signal manager. They can be used offensively in game modes like Capture the Flag, Search and Destroy or Domination to give a unique identity to certain classes.
You will use the following devices.
  * 1 x **Signal Remote Manager** and **Signal Remote**
  * Multiple [**Customizable Lights**](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-customizable-light-devices-in-fortnite-creative)
  * 1 x [Timed Objective Device](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-timed-objective-devices-in-fortnite-creative)

  1. Build a structure to house an objective, such as a flag or Capture Area device. Set the time of day and optionally use additional lighting such as a Skydome device to darken the map.
  2. Place a Customizable Light device within the building. Customize the following settings.
[![Light Settings](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/8e31444c-fe30-403a-8656-677d6d70dcb9?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/8e31444c-fe30-403a-8656-677d6d70dcb9?resizing_type=fit)

**Turn On When Receiving From** |  Channel 2 |  Automatically turns the lights back on with a Timed Objective device a short duration after being shut off.
**Turn Off When Receiving From** |  Channel 1 |  The Signal Remote primary fire will turn off the lights and set the automatic reboot from the Timed Objective device.
  3. Duplicate the customizable light and populate the interior with copies until it is well lit.
  4. Place a Timed Objective device anywhere on the island. Customize it to the following settings.
[![Timed Objective Settings](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/b30505ea-0eac-4474-b07a-b4f8e5f2f297?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/b30505ea-0eac-4474-b07a-b4f8e5f2f297?resizing_type=fit)

**Cooldown Time** |  1 Second |  Time between transmitting signals on the Signal Remote.
**On Primary Activation Transmit On** |  Channel 1 |  Transmits the signal to turn off the lights and activate the Timed Objective device automatically rebooting it.

You have now set up a Signal Remote weapon that operates as a remote hacking device.
Set the cooldown time longer than 1 second. This was used for demonstration, but the actual class should have a longer cooldown. You could also combine the above elements, to open shortcuts that are normally locked and might be poorly defended. Alternatively, you can set classes to temporarily activate Sentry devices on a cooldown, which help defend the base when it is attacked.
