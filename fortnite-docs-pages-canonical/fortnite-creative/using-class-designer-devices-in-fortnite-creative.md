# Class Designer Devices
Define custom classes and assign specific attributes and inventory loadouts for each class.
![Class Designer Devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/3a0ae817-ab0a-4d26-9941-907e0c666d93?resizing_type=fill&width=1920&height=335)
The **Class Designer** device is used in conjunction with the [Class Selector](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-class-selector-devices-in-fortnite-creative) device to make it easy to create [class-based gameplay](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary).
The Class Designer gives you a way to define a custom [class](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) with an initial set of [attributes](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) and an inventory [loadout](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary).
Each device is used to design one custom class. To define the inventory loadout for this class, drop [items](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) onto the device to [register](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) them for that class.
The Class Identifier is used by:
  * The **[Class Selector](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/class-selector)** device
  * The Team Settings & Inventory device
  * **Island** **Settings**

There is a hierarchy of setting overrides, described as follows:
  * Island Settings are the baseline.
  * Team Settings & Inventory overrides Island Settings if there is a specific value set in the device.
  * Class Designer overrides both Team Settings & Inventory and Island Settings, if there is a specific value set in the device that differs from the Island Settings or Team Settings & Inventory values.

See the pages under Island Settings for more info.
For information on finding the Class Designer device, see [Using Devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-devices-in-fortnite).
If you're using multiple copies of a device on an island, it can be helpful to [rename](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) them. You can choose names that relate to each device's purpose, so it's easier to remember what each one does.
##  Device Options
A player cannot interact with this device in [Play mode](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) even if it is visible. This device has some basic functionality, like setting the maximum health and shields for the class, and whether items are granted to the player when they respawn. Additionally, there are some advanced options, such as turning on player movement features like Sprinting and Sliding.
###  Contextual Filtering
Some devices are affected by a feature called **contextual filtering**. This feature hides or displays options depending on the values selected for certain related options. This reduces clutter in the Customize panel and makes options easier to manage and navigate. To help identify them, values that trigger contextual filtering are in _italic_.
All options are listed, including those affected by contextual filtering; if they are hidden or displayed based on a specific option's value, there will be a note about it in the Description field for that option.
Default values are **bold**. Values that trigger contextual filtering are _italic_.
You can configure this device with the following options.
