# Capture Area Devices
Use the Capture Area device to create a zone for item drop-off or point-capture objectives.

######  Prerequisite topics
In order to understand and use the content on this page, make sure you are familiar with the following topics:
  * [Getting Started with Devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/getting-started-with-devices-in-fortnite)

The **Capture Area** device is a zone that can [trigger](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) effects once players enter it. It can be set up to be capturable by a team, to provide a score while held, or to require a specific item as a drop-off.
The main form of interaction with the capture area is for a player to step inside the zone. It can also trigger based on players dropping an item in the zone if you set the options to do that.
Depending on the options you customize, you can cause events to occur based on whether players step inside or if they stay inside for a certain length of time. There are several ways you can use the Capture Area:
  * The capture area can be used as an **item capture** device, such as for Capture the Flag games. When you drop an item onto the device in [Create mode](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary), the item can be set to require players to interact with this device.
  * The capture area can hold one item. If an item is held, the **Item Filter** option determines whether players need the item in question to interact with the device. You can drop a new item to replace the one currently in the device.
  * The capture area can be used as a **periodic scoring** device. While within the area, players can gain a certain amount of score for every defined time period.
  * The capture area can be used as a **control point** that is owned by a team and capturable by other teams. You can set how control of the area is gained and lost by teams.

Optionally, the capture area can have a floating **[HUD](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) marker** that shows players where the Capture Area is. This can display the Capture Area's current status, such as its captured percentage, its letter designation (if it has one), and the team that owns the Capture Area.
The device has a **pulse effect** when it is captured or interacted with, and the device shows the current capture percentage. When players start to capture an area, an effect will display on the players that are on the capturing team.
Looking for a spark of creative freedom? See **[Down But Not Out Device Design Example](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/down-but-not-out-device-design-examples-in-fortnite-creative)** to liberate your imagination!
To find the Capture Area device, see [Using Devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-devices-in-fortnite).
If you're using multiple copies of a device on an island, it can be helpful to [rename](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) them. Choosing names that relate to a device's purpose makes it easier to remember what each one does, and easier to find a specific device when using the [Event Browser](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/event-browser-in-fortnite-creative).
##  Device Options
In its [default](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) state, the capture area has no interaction. It requires setup before it can be used.
Default values are in **bold**. Values that trigger [contextual filtering](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) are in _italics_.
Option  |  Value  |  Description
---|---|---
**Starting Team** |  **All** , Pick a team |  Which team owns the capture area at the start of the game. Can be used to determine who can interact with it (only friendlies or only enemies).
**Accent Color Type** |  _**Direct Color**_ , Team Color, Team Relationship |  Choose what determines the color of the capture area zone and base. **Direct Color** is the default; if you choose another value for this option, the **Accent Color** option will be hidden.

**Periodic Scoring** |  **Off** , Each Player, One Player Per Team, Owning Team |  Determines if every player in the area gains score, or if only one player for each team gains score (if you are counting the score for a team game).

**Partial Progress Decay Speed** |  **Instant** , No Decay, Pick a multiplier |  If the team that has partially captured an area stops capturing, this determines how fast (as a percentage of the capture or neutralization speed) any partial progress decays.
**Controlling Team Can Revert Partial Progress** |  **Yes** , No |  If this is set to **Yes** , players on the team owning the area can reverse some of the progress of other teams by standing in the area.
**Capture Allowed on Game Start** |  **Yes** , No |  The area is either in a capturable or non-capturable state. This determines whether it is in the capturable state when the game starts.
