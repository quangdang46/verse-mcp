# Attribute Evaluator Devices
This device transmits an event based on the attributes of any triggering player.
![Attribute Evaluator Devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/1a195103-abc3-425e-9c01-0c8d508d1919?resizing_type=fill&width=1920&height=335)
The **Attribute Evaluator** only works with signals received from other devices. It acts as [branching logic](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary), and checks whether the player that sent the signal passes all of the tests that are set up for this trigger. Then the [trigger](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) sends a signal on either a success channel or a failure channel. With this trigger, you can test whether a player has reached a specific condition, and determine what happens when that occurs.
The attribute evaluator checks against the stats of the player at the point it is activated. If it receives a signal from an event that changes one of the player's stats (for example, if it receives a signal from the Elimination Manager that a player has just eliminated an enemy), the player's stats might not have been updated from that event. See [Loo Roll Rush](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/loo-roll-rush-in-fortnite-creative) for an example of this problem.
For help on how to find the **Attribute Evaluator** device, see [Using Devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite-creative/using-devices-in-fortnite-creative).
