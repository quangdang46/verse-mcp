A **Barrier** device creates a customized zone that blocks players and weapon fire. It can also be used to create different visual styles that decorate levels throughout environments.
For an island with a complicated shape and layout, the barrier zone can serve as the map border, providing a [clean collision](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) that avoids collision issues.
For information on finding the Barrier device, see [Using Devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-devices-in-fortnite).
##  Device Options
Once a barrier device is placed in the island, it generates an invisible collision box the size of one standard building tile. This box blocks both player movement and ranged weapon fire.
You can configure the device with the following options.
Default values are **bold**.

**Zone Shape** |  **Box** , Hollow Box, Cylinder |  Sets the shape of the zone.
**Barrier Depth** |  **1.0** , Pick or enter an amount |  Determines the depth of the barrier in tiles.

**Invisible to Ignored Players** |  On, **Off** |  Determines whether or not players on the ignored list can see the barrier. If the barrier is invisible, it has no collision and can be moved through.
**Can NPC Added to Ignore List** |  On,**Off** |  Determines if NPCs can be added to the ignore list of the barrier. Once any NPC is added, all NPCs will be ignored by the device since they share the same navigation data.
**Affected by Fade Distance** |  **On** , Off |  Whether the barrier should fade when past its fade distance. If ON, the barrier will be disabled when players are further than the Fade Distance , and Enabled when they are closer. If OFF, the barrier will always remain enabled, regardless of the player's distance to the barrier.
