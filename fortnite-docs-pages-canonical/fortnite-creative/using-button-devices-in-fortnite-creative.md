You can use a [Button](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) device to activate other [devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary). In its [default](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) state, the button does nothing, but when configured to work with another device, the button can activate another [device](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) when a player interacts with it.
For help on how to find the Button device, see [Using Devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-devices-in-fortnite).

If you're using multiple copies of a device on an island, it can be useful to [rename](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) them. Choosing names that relate to a device's purpose makes it easier to remember what each one does, and easier to find a specific device when using the [Event Browser](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/event-browser-in-fortnite-creative).
##  Device Options
To pair a button with another device, you need to specify the [event binding](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) for the player interaction with the button.
