Spawn a ball that your players can knock around!
![Ball Spawner Devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/e2506d69-81d4-4b77-b579-58c2c8b9b75f?resizing_type=fill&width=1920&height=335)
The **Ball Spawner** device [spawns](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) a ball at the start of the game. This ball is relatively light by default, and can be knocked around by players. It will be consumed when it touches a [capture area](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary).
While the Ball Spawner cannot be interacted with, the **ball** it spawns can be knocked around by other objects or players. A player can shove it, shoot it, or hit it with a pickaxe to knock it in a specific direction.
To find the Ball Spawner device, see [Using Devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-devices-in-fortnite).
If you're using multiple copies of a device on an island, it can be helpful to [rename](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) them. Choosing names that relate to a device's purpose makes it easier to remember what each one does, and easier to find a specific device when using the [Event Browser](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/event-browser-in-fortnite-creative).
##  Contextual Filtering
Some devices are affected by a feature called **contextual filtering**. This feature hides or displays options depending on the values selected for certain related options. This feature will reduce clutter in the Customize panel and make options easier to manage and navigate.
However it may not be easy to recognize which options or values trigger contextual filtering. To help you identify them, any values that trigger contextual filtering are in _italic_. All options will be listed, including those affected by contextual filtering; if they are hidden or displayed based on a specific option's value, there will be a note about that in the Description field for that option.
