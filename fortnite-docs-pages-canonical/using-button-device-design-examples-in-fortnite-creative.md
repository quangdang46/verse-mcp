A **button** is a device you can use to trigger other devices when a player pushes the button.
Here are a couple of examples of how to use Button devices to build gameplay.
  * [Door Hack](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-button-device-design-examples-in-fortnite-creative)
  * [Team Buttons](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-button-device-design-examples-in-fortnite-creative)

##  Door Hack
Use a button to provide player interaction with a prop by increasing the radius of the prop and adding text for player instruction.
###  Devices Used
  * 1 x **Button**
  * 1 x [Lock](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-lock-devices-in-fortnite-creative)

###  Build It Yourself
  1. Place a Button device over the prop you want to use. In this example, it is a computer on a desk but you can use it with any prop.
  2. Customize the button to the following settings:
[![Door Hack Computer Button](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/cb39df26-031b-4a6f-a810-0abfb426d4b5?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/cb39df26-031b-4a6f-a810-0abfb426d4b5?resizing_type=fit)
Option  |  Value  |  Description
---|---|---
Interact Time |  5.0 Seconds |  Time needed to interact with the button before it activates.
Trigger Sound |  Disabled |  No sound effects are played when the button is activated.
Interaction Text |  Hack Door... |  The UI text displayed when the player looks at and interacts with the button. In this case, the text implies the computer is being used to hack.
Visible During Game |  No |  The button is not visible during gameplay.
Interaction Radius |  1.0 Meters |  The distance from the button the player can be while still bringing up the interaction prompt.
  3. Place a door in another spot in the room, then place a **Lock** device adjacent to the door, making sure the light turns blue to indicate it is paired with the door.
  4. Customize it to the following settings:
[![Door Hack Lock](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/5a4cbbaf-73e4-4d81-a5ac-26f887a5927e?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/5a4cbbaf-73e4-4d81-a5ac-26f887a5927e?resizing_type=fit)
Option  |  Value  |  Description
---|---|---
Visible During Game |  Off |  The lock is not visible during gameplay.
  5. Set the button's direct event bindings to the following:

Function  |  Device  |  Event  |  Description
---|---|---|---
On Interact Send Event To |  LockDevice |  Open |  When the player interacts with the button, the door that the lock is attached to will open.

Here's an overview of how devices communicate in this Design Example:
Device A  |  Function  |  Device B  |  Event  |  Explanation
---|---|---|---|---
**LockDevice** |  Open |  **Button** |  On Interact Send Event To |  When the player interacts with the button, the door that the lock is attached to will open.
You now have the basic functionality for players interacting with props using the button.
There are many ways to set up interactive props using the Button device. This device, when invisible, has a highly customizable area to expand interaction coverage, and can be used both narratively and for immersion, or for basic gameplay. [HUD Messages](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-hud-message-devices-in-fortnite-creative) can play in response to player interaction, [Teleporters](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-teleporter-devices-in-fortnite-creative) can be activated, or [**Billboards**](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-billboard-devices-in-fortnite-creative) rendered visible, providing a lot of flexibility for your game design.
##  Team Buttons
You can also place buttons that can only be activated by specific teams.

  3. Near the button, place a **Class Selector**. Customize it to the following settings:
[![Class Selector 1](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/269abc09-f424-401e-807c-17cc3465b39d?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/269abc09-f424-401e-807c-17cc3465b39d?resizing_type=fit)

[![Button Events](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/bbf03e60-4deb-4d1d-baab-777d7c068daf?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/bbf03e60-4deb-4d1d-baab-777d7c068daf?resizing_type=fit)
Function  |  Device  |  Event  |  Description
---|---|---|---
On Interact Send Event To |  Team1HUDMessage |  Show |  When the player interacts with the button, the corresponding HUD Message will appear.
  8. Repeat step 7 with the Team 2 Button and corresponding HUD device.

Here's an overview of how devices communicate in this design example:
Device A  |  Function  |  Device B  |  Event  |  Explanation
---|---|---|---|---
**Team1 HUD Message** |  Show |  **Team1 Button** |  On Interact Send Event To |  When the player interacts with the button, the corresponding HUD Message will appear.
**Team2 HUD Message** |  Show |  **Team2 Button** |  On Interact Send Event To |  When the player interacts with the button, the corresponding HUD Message will appear.
You now have the basic structure for using team-restricted buttons to communicate.
Restricting buttons to specific classes or teams is a way to create avenues that are gated behind specific individuals or teams. Doors can be locked except when a button is pressed by a team member, certain classes can cause active defenses to appear, such as hostile sentries, or cause temporary walls and other shifted geometry to change the dynamics of the map in response to gameplay. They can also be used for teleporting to new areas, or equipping new, location-optimized loadouts.
