![39.10 Fortnite Ecosystem Updates and Release Notes](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/c730a6ee-6a75-46ad-82ee-7c01ec6b6ced?resizing_type=fill&width=1920&height=335)
The 39.10 release adds new LEGO® NINJAGO® content, including a starter island template and themed assets, and delivers new mobile UI enhancements to support cleaner interfaces on mobile devices. Also included: new Twinkle Terrace Prefabs and Galleries!
##  Action Required: Verse API Change for In-Island Transactions
For developers using the experimental release of in-island transactions, we have made a change to the Marketplace module in the Verse API. The `product` class has been renamed to `entitlement`. You will need to update your Verse code for any items you have created, replacing `product` with `entitlement`.
Additionally, the In-Island Transactions feature example and all of the documentation has been updated to account for the entitlement change, if you need additional examples or references.
For 39.10, the experimental flag has been removed for in-island transactions, but publishing will not go live until 39.20 (January 9, 2026).

##  LEGO® NINJAGO® Assets Are Now Available!
Spinning into this launch are NINJAGO assets for you to create ninja-themed LEGO islands.
###  Art Template
Kick start your island design with the **NINJAGO Starter Island** template. This art template provides prebuilt environment designs to spark your imagination. The environment structures include brick-built modules that you can add to or disassemble with the Brick Editor.
[![Use the NINJAGO Starter Island template to start building a ninja-themed LEGO island.](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/d257ccef-2fc1-4c2a-b737-6976bc6c8560?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/d257ccef-2fc1-4c2a-b737-6976bc6c8560?resizing_type=fit)

  * **Earth Master Cole**
  * **Fire Master Kai**
  * **Lighting Master Jay**
  * **Ice Master Zane**

###  Device Updates and Fixes
#####  Fixes:
  * Fixed an issue where the Reboot Van device user options did not seem to work and materials would flicker.
  * Fixed an issue where the Reboot Van device displayed "Not Enough Gold" instead of "Missing Items: ITEM NAME (RARITY)".
  * Exposed Henchfan Cosmetics for use in for NPC Character Spawner.
  * [General Physics] Fixed a problem with VFX/SFX retriggering on prop collision with Crash Pad devices: Implemented virtual OnBeginOverlap that triggers when an object is overlapping now, but wasn't seen overlapping for over a second. It's a per-object implementation so that objects that are already stuck on the crash pad don't stop other objects from triggering the FX; the overlapping tracks the objects independently.
  * [General Physics] Fixed a problem with VFX/SFX retriggering on prop collision with Bouncer Gallery devices. This is the same modification done on the Crash Pad, but for the Bouncer devices.
  * [General Physics] Fixed an issue where gliding could appear broken when a player was falling from an elevated teleporter.
  * [General Physics] Events are now sent to the Explosive device which triggers an explosion.
  * [General Physics] SFX and VFX are now displayed properly for all bouncers of the Bouncer Gallery when a prop activates them.
  * [General Physics] Emoting on a moving prop no longer keeps characters in the emote animation.
  * [General Physics] Contrails in the Skydive Volume are now visible at all times.
  * Fixed an issue where the Air Vent FX played constantly. This also fixed anything that used the FortPhysicsImpulseComponent and that used OnPhysicsImpulseOverlapTriggered.
  * Fixed an issue where the Teleporter device did not apply direct velocity (it applied impulse instead).
  * Fixed an issue where the Teleporter device was teleporting non-stop.
  * Fixed an issue where the Pinball Flipper would rotate abnormally on game start.

##  Mobile UI Enhancements
You now have additional tools to create cleaner interfaces for players on mobile devices.
  * A new setting in the Cinematic Sequence device hides unused mobile inputs during active cinematics (this is set to Off by default).
  * Mobile gameplay inputs (jump, crouch, fire) are hidden while players interact with popups.
  * Two new settings in the HUD Controller device feature the ability to **Hide** or **Show** the vehicle UI. The **Fuel** , **Speed** , **Boost** and **Vehicle Health** options have also been added to the Verse API. With these updates, you have the option to add custom vehicle UI using Verse.
[![You can now use Verse to add custom vehicle UI for players on mobile platforms.](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/90f26a4b-e513-4392-8c36-440e0db900c7?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/90f26a4b-e513-4392-8c36-440e0db900c7?resizing_type=fit)

##  New Device Design Examples
  * [Visual Effect Powerup Device Design Examples](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/visual-effect-powerup-device-design-examples-in-fortnite)
[![Follow these design examples to learn new ways to use the Visual Effect Powerup device.](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/b4b4efb1-f263-438f-8585-462d515b7b29?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/b4b4efb1-f263-438f-8585-462d515b7b29?resizing_type=fit)
These design examples show you how to use the **Visual Effect Powerup** device in your island gameplay to validate player behavior with a visual effect, such as when the player picks up an item or reaches a destination. Use this device to reinforce in-game information, communicate the importance of an event, or make characters sparkle just for fun!

  * Fixed an issue that was triggering Verse-only pushes while exporting localization data, such as what happens when trying to run the memory calculation.
  * When displaying the Island Conversion Failed message box, the raw error message is no longer displayed. Instead, a friendly message instructing the user to look at the Output Log is displayed.
