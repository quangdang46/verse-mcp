# Timer Devices
Timer Devices can be controlled manually, or integrated with other devices using direct event binding.
![Timer Devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/d7ced8aa-1f07-4501-b270-ffa202e645a7?resizing_type=fill&width=1920&height=335)
The **Timer device** provides a way for players to keep track of the time something has taken, either for scoreboard purposes or to trigger actions. It can be configured in several ways, and act either as a countdown to an event that is triggered at the end, or as a stopwatch for an action that needs to be completed before a set time runs out.
To find the Timer device, see the instructions in [Using Devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-devices-in-fortnite).
##  Timer States
The Timer device has different **states** it can be in at different times. The possible states are listed below, with descriptions. Some options move the device from one state to another, or trigger an action when the device enters a particular state.
Timer State  |  Description
---|---
**Start** |  If a timer is **Paused** , this option will cause it to start ticking down to zero from its current time.
**Pause** |  A **Paused** timer does not change time. It can be restarted.
**Reset** |  When a timer is **Reset** , it sets the time remaining to the total duration and **Pauses** the timer.
**Stopped** |  A **Stopped** timer does not change time. It cannot be restarted and must be reset.
**Complete** |  Stops the timer and plays effects to let players know it has **completed**.
**Time-Out** |  When a timer reaches zero seconds, it has **timed out** and stops counting down. This may or may not complete the timer, depending on the device settings used.
##  Contextual Filtering
Some devices are affected by a feature called contextual filtering. This feature hides or displays options depending on the values selected for certain related options. This feature will reduce clutter in the Customize panel and make options easier to manage and navigate.
However, it may not be easy to recognize which options or values trigger contextual filtering. To help you identify them, in our device docs we use italic for any values that trigger contextual filtering. All options will be listed, including those affected by contextual filtering; if they are hidden or displayed based on a specific option’s value, there will be a note about that in the Description field for that option.
##  Device Options
In its [default](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#default) state, the Timer device is a countdown clock. At the start of a game, the timer shows a one-minute countdown, but by default does not start counting down. You will need to adjust the device options to use it. Players can't interact directly with the device, although they can trigger it indirectly by interacting with other devices that are [bound](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#direct-event-binding) to the timer.
Configure this device with the following options.
Default values are in **bold**. Values that trigger contextual filtering are _italic_.
Option  |  Value  |  Description
---|---|---

**Timer Name** |  Enter text into field |  Type a name for the timer. The text field has a limit of 24 characters.

**Success on Timer End** |  **True** , False |  If timer reaches the end of the countdown instead of being triggered by an event, whether this counts as a success (true) or failure (false). For example, a success would be making it to the end of the countdown for a survival-type game, but a failure for a timed-objective game.
**Completion Behavior** |  Disable, **Stop** , Reset, Restart |  Determines what happens when the timer finishes counting. Values for this option are:
  * **Disable** : Puts the device into the Disabled state.

**Auto-Load** |  **On** , Off |  This option only displays if the **Use Persistence** option is set to **Yes**. Determines whether the timer automatically loads when the player joins or rejoins the game. If set to **Off** the timer can only be loaded using event binding.
**Auto-Load When** |  Join In Progress, **Always** |  This option only displays if the **Use Persistence** option is set to **Yes**. Determines if the auto-load occurs only when the player joins a game in progress, or whether it always loads when a player joins or rejoins a game in progress.
**Enable Urgency Mode** |  **Off** , On |  Allows device to enter urgency mode at the time set in the **Urgency Mode Time** option. If this is set to **On** additional options display.
