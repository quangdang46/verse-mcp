# Animated Mesh Device
Create unique animations for your skeletal meshes with the Animated Mesh device.
![Animated Mesh Device](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/f1d3d0b2-bf55-453b-8644-52909d6e9361?resizing_type=fill&width=1920&height=335)
The **Animated Mesh** [device](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/unreal-editor-for-fortnite-glossary#device) provides a way for creators to play animations on [skeletal meshes](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/unreal-editor-for-fortnite-glossary#skeletal-mesh) ([FBX files](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/unreal-editor-for-fortnite-glossary#fbx)) with FBX animation files in Unreal Editor for Fortnite (UEFN). Think of it as creating a new actor for players to interact with.
For example:
  * Create a boss for players to fight at the end of a level.
  * Create a new NPC that players can interact with.
  * Move or animate a [prop](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/unreal-editor-for-fortnite-glossary#prop).
  * Create special animations to use in conjunction with the [Cinematic Sequence device](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-cinematic-sequence-device-in-unreal-editor-for-fortnite) to create a [cutscene](https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/creative/docs/fortnite-creative-glossary#cutscene) between [levels](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/unreal-editor-for-fortnite-glossary#level).

The device [memory](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) depends on the referenced animation sets.
Playtest your animations to make sure that they work in Fortnite Creative.
