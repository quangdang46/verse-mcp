# Roly Poly Devices
Add Roly Poly devices to your island for a bug filled adventure.
![Roly Poly Devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/501bc867-6286-4ae9-93da-626da14f574f?resizing_type=fill&width=1920&height=335)
Place a **Roly Poly** device on your island to spawn a sensitive, ridable, bug-type critter as an alternative transportation system. Roly Polies are non-menacing creatures that can be spawned and ridden, and curl up when attacked.
You can use Roly Polies to create a colony that players need to soothe when the Roly Polies get scared!
Roly Polies are not spawnable wildlife AI, and don’t share the following wildlife AI attributes:
  * They are not tameable by players.
  * They are not assignable to a team.
  * You cannot spawn more than one Roly Poly at a time.
  * They do not wander, patrol, or use an AI patrol path.

For help on how to find the **Roly Poly** device, see [Using Devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-devices-in-fortnite) .
If you're using multiple copies of a device on an island, it can be useful to [rename](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#rename-a-device) them. Choosing names that relate to a device's purpose makes it easier to remember what each one does, and easier to find a specific device when using the [Event Browser](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/event-browser-in-fortnite-creative).
##  Contextual Filtering in Creative
In Creative, some devices are affected by a feature called **contextual filtering**. This feature hides or displays options depending on the values selected for certain related options. This reduces clutter in the Customize panel and makes options easier to manage and navigate. To help identify them, values that trigger contextual filtering are in italic.
All options are listed, including those affected by contextual filtering; if they are hidden or displayed based on a specific option's value, there will be a note about it in the Description field for that option.
##  Device Options
This section details the **device options** (in Creative) or **user options** (in UEFN).
  * To customize options in Creative, approach a device and press **E** to open the **Customize** panel.
  * To customize options in UEFN, select the device in your viewport or in the Outliner. Options for this device are found in the **Details** panel, in the **User Options** section.
