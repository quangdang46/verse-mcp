The **War Bus Spawner** device creates a more rugged, low-tech version of the Battle Bus suited to desert and wasteland islands. Unique features include:
  * Instead of turrets, the War Bus has **nautical cannons** mounted on top that shoot a powerful linear shot that explodes on impact, with a large damage radius.
  * Players can use the **Horn** input to deploy a powerful electromagnetic pulse (EMP) that damages player shields and disables other vehicles.

For help on how to find the [**War Bus Spawner**] device, see [**Using Devices**](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-devices-in-fortnite-creative).
If you're using multiple copies of a device on an island, it can be useful to [rename](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#rename-a-device) them. Choosing names that relate to a device's purpose makes it easier to remember what each one does, and easier to find a specific device when using the [**Event Browser**](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/event-browser-in-fortnite-creative).
##  Contextual Filtering
Some devices are affected by a feature called **contextual filtering**. This feature hides or displays options depending on the values selected for certain related options. This reduces clutter in the Customize panel and makes options easier to manage and navigate. To help identify them, values that trigger contextual filtering are in _italic_.
All options are listed, including those affected by contextual filtering; if they are hidden or displayed based on a specific option's value, there will be a note about it in the Description field for that option.
