# Pinball Flipper Devices
The Pinball Flipper can knock players back, damage them, and give them score.
![Pinball Flipper Devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/8cede313-dd8d-4352-acc0-44faff6343b3?resizing_type=fill&width=1920&height=335)
The **Pinball Flipper** device can move, [damage](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#damage), and give score to players that interact with it. By default, it is activated by any player touching its front face, which rotates it counterclockwise and knocks those players away from it and slightly upward.
The Pinball Flipper can be set to activate when objects of the correct team touch it on either side (depending on the options selected). It can also be configured to [trigger](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) when taking any damage.
When activated, the device makes a noise and [knocks players back](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#knockback), then the top of the Pinball Flipper retracts into the body until it is ready to activate again. If set to a non-glowing color, the Pinball Flipper will also glow briefly when activated.
For help on how to find the **Pinball Flipper** device, see [Using Devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-devices-in-fortnite).
If you're using multiple copies of a device on an island, it can be useful to rename them. Choosing names that relate to a device's purpose makes it easier to remember what each one does, and easier to find a specific device when using the [Event Browser](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/event-browser-in-fortnite-creative).
##  Contextual Filtering
Some devices are affected by a feature called **contextual filtering**. This feature hides or displays options depending on the values selected for certain related options. This feature will reduce clutter in the Customize panel and make options easier to manage and navigate.
However, it may not be easy to recognize which options or values trigger contextual filtering. To help you identify them, in our device docs we use _italic_ for any values that trigger contextual filtering. All options will be listed, including those affected by contextual filtering; if they are hidden or displayed based on a specific option's value, there will be a note about that in the Description field for that option.
###  Device Options
The device options let you configure the Pinball Flipper's appearance. You can also determine the effects that occur when interacting with the flipper (knockback, damage, and score), and how strong those effects are.
You can configure this device with the following options.
Default values are **bold**. Values that trigger contextual filtering are _italic_.
