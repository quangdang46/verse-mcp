When a player picks up or [triggers](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) the **Damage Amplifier Powerup** device, their ability to [deal damage](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) to another player or [NPC (non-player character)](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) is instantly amplified. This applies to any weapon the player is using at the time of the powerup.
The effect is temporary but you can customize the powerup duration.
You can also control which players, teams or [classes](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) can use this [powerup](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary), how much the powerup is amplified (multiplied), how long it lasts, and a number of other customizable features. You can use it to give one team an advantage — especially when playing against NPCs — or to level the playing field. It’s also a useful [pickup](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) for players [in-game](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary).
To find the Damage Powerup device, see [Using Devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-devices-in-fortnite).
It’s helpful to [customize device names](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) when you use multiple copies of the same device.
##  Contextual Filtering
Some devices are affected by a feature called **contextual filtering**. This feature hides or displays options depending on the values selected for certain related options. This reduces clutter in the Customize panel and makes options easier to manage and navigate. To help identify them, values that trigger contextual filtering are in _italic_.
All options are listed, including those affected by contextual filtering; if they are hidden or displayed based on a specific option's value, there will be a note about it in the Description field for that option.
