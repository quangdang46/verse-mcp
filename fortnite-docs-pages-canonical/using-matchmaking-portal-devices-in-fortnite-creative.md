You can use the **Matchmaking Portal** to create a [portal](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#portal) that [warps](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#warp) players from one island to another. You can make a game that crosses multiple islands, and use these portals to get players from one to the other. You can also use portals to build a hub on each of your islands that displays all your creations and gives players the opportunity to try them out.
If you have active matchmaking portals on your island, players will now see the full-screen Activity Details screen just as they would in the Multi-product Lobby. Also, if a player's account has Parent controls active, a parent can unlock islands from this Activity Details screen just like they can do from the Multi-product Lobby.
