A **Baller Spawner** is a device that [spawns](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) a [Baller](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) vehicle into the level at the spawner's given location and orientation.
Some ideas for using the Baller:
  * Use Baller Spawner devices in combination with the [Racing Checkpoint Device](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) to design a racing game for your players.
  * You can place a player directly inside the Baller using a trigger or with event binding.

To find the Baller Spawner device, see [Using Devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite-creative/using-devices-in-fortnite-creative).
If you're using multiple copies of a device on an island, it can be useful to [rename](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) them. Choosing names that relate to a device's purpose makes it easier to remember what each one does, and easier to find a specific device when using the [Event Browser](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/event-browser-in-fortnite-creative).
##  Contextual Filtering
Some devices are affected by a feature called **contextual filtering**. This feature hides or displays options depending on the values selected for certain related options. This reduces clutter in the Customize panel and makes options easier to manage and navigate. To help identify them, values that trigger contextual filtering are in _italic_.
All options are listed, including those affected by contextual filtering; if they are hidden or displayed based on a specific option's value, there will be a note about it in the Description field for that option.
