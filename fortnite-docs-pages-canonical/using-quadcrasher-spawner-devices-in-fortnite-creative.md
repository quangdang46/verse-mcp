![Quadcrasher Spawner Devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/508787ce-86e1-4cca-870a-779fc0f48382?resizing_type=fill&width=1920&height=335)
A **Quadcrasher Spawner** is a device that [spawns](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#spawning) a Quadcrasher vehicle onto your island at the spawner's given location and orientation.
You can place a player directly inside the Quadcrasher using a trigger.
For help on how to find the **Quadcrasher Spawner** device, see [Using Devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-devices-in-fortnite).
If you're using multiple copies of a device on an island, it can be useful to [rename](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite-creative/rename-a-device) them. Choosing names that relate to a device's purpose makes it easier to remember what each one does, and easier to find a specific device when using the [Event Browser](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite-creative/event-browser-in-fortnite-creative).
##  Contextual Filtering
Some devices are affected by a feature called contextual filtering. This feature hides or displays options depending on the values selected for certain related options. This feature will reduce clutter in the Customize panel and make options easier to manage and navigate.
However, it may not be easy to recognize which options or values trigger contextual filtering. To help you identify them, in our device docs we use italic for any values that trigger contextual filtering. All options will be listed, including those affected by contextual filtering; if they are hidden or displayed based on a specific option’s value, there will be a note about that in the Description field for that option.
##  Device Options
This device has some basic functionality, like whether it is visible in game, or whether it supports [wraps](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#wrap).

##  Channels
When one device needs to "talk" to another device, it does so by [transmitting](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) a [signal](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) on a specific [channel](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary). The receiving device needs to be set up to [receive](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#receive) the signal on the same channel.
A channel is identified by a number, and channel numbers are customized for a device under the option that uses the channel. Most devices will also pass the identity of the player who [triggered](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) the device with the signal.
When the Quadcrasher Spawner device receives a signal on a channel, it can be enabled or disabled, can spawn or destroy a vehicle, and assign a driver. It can transmit a signal on a channel when a player enters or exits the vehicle, and when the vehicle is spawned or destroyed.
###  Receivers
