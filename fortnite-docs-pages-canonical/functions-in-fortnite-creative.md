##  DESCRIPTION OF CLASS/LEARNING ENVIRONMENT 
This lesson is designed for **Hour of Code** during Computer Science Education Week.
This can serve as a stand-alone lesson, or be used in conjunction with the other activities to complete a larger project.
Author Steve Isaacs teaches Game Design and Development as a quest- or choice-based learning environment that provides students with opportunities to take different approaches to meeting the learning outcomes based on their own interests, in terms of content as well as project options.
Author Brian Dickman studied computer science and operates a full-time game development studio that produces entertaining and educational content inside popular video games.
##  Lesson Overview 
Do you have what it takes to escape the trivia tower? Better yet, do you have what it takes to create a trivia tower escape game?
This activity will demonstrate the use of functions in Fortnite Creative as you are tasked with creating a game that requires the player to answer a number of trivia questions in order to escape. Each correct answer will trigger the function to allow the player to advance along with a rewarding tune and visual effect. Incorrect answers will trigger not-so-pleasant sound and visual effect and require the player to try again.
By completing this activity, students will understand the basics of functions as they relate to coding through the use of the sequencer and a series of devices.
##  Desired Results 
What are the learning outcomes for students?
###  ESSENTIAL QUESTIONS/BIG IDEAS 
Can students learn computer science concepts as part of a meaningful activity rather than simply learning syntax as an isolated skill?
Will learning computer science concepts like functions through an activity in Fortnite Creative generalize to understanding the concept in a coding environment?
Can students learn computer science concepts through game mechanics?
Will students show more motivation to learn computer science when the concepts are introduced in a game environment?
##  Learning Activities 
###  Introduction to Functions 
A **function** is a unit of code that is often defined by its role within a greater code structure. Specifically, a function contains a unit of code that works on various inputs, many of which are variables, and produces concrete results involving changes to variable values or actual operations based on the inputs.
– from [Techopedia.com](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/25615/function)
Or more simply put:
A **function** is a piece of code that you can easily call over and over again.
– from [code.org](https://curriculum.code.org/csd-1718/unit3/19/)
For example, the activity in this lesson will have students set up a number of functions to be used to run a trivia game show in Fortnite Creative. Essentially, each function (represented by the sequencer) will run a series of commands (using devices) in the game.
**Pseudocode** is the act of simulating writing code to illustrate the idea that the code would represent. Pseudocode would show the general structure but does not necessarily follow proper syntax. In these lessons we will periodically use pseudocode to demonstrate the concepts.
In terms of pseudocode, this could look like
**Function 1 (askQuestion): starting the round/asking the player a question** **Function 2 (startTimer): the countdown timer**
myFunction(askQuestion) Do the following Reset answer buttons Play sound Choose random number for trivia question Present the Question myFunction(startTimer) Start countdown timer If countdown gets to 0 Then Time is up Play sound Show message (“Sorry, you did not answer in time”) Activate next question End function End function
**Function 3: (correctAnswer)** myFunction(correctAnswer) Do the following Play happy sound Show message (“Correct! Great job!!”) Add point to score Activate next question EndFunction EndFunction
**Function 4: (wrongAnswer)** myFunction(wrongAnswer) Do the following Play bad sound Show message (“Sorry, Try again!”) Activate next question EndFunction
In the example above, when the function (askQuestion) is initiated, a number of things happen:
  1. Reset answer buttons.
  2. Play a sound to indicate the question will be coming up.
  3. Choose a random number to determine which trivia question to ask.
  4. Present the question to the player.


Then we introduce another function (startTimer) which initiates:
  1. Start countdown timer.
  2. Play a sound if the timer reaches 0 to conclude the opportunity to answer this question.


We add two additional functions (correctAnswer) and (wrongAnswer). These initiate the following:
  1. Play a sound.
  2. Adjust score if appropriate.
  3. Display a message.
  4. Activate the next question.


Here is a video that explains functions:
[CS Principles: Defining and Calling Functions](https://youtu.be/yPWQfa4CHbw)
Functions can be used in any coding language, and also in environments like Fortnite Creative.
In Fortnite, we will use the [Sequencer](https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/creative/docs/using-pulse-trigger-devices-in-fortnite-creative) and place our events/actions within the Sequencer so that when the Sequencer is activated, the actions inside will be executed.
##  Activities 
Refer to the Student Guide and Teacher Notes for the step-by-step directions for the activity.
Students should access and work from the Student Guide.
Use the downloadable rubric to assess student work.
