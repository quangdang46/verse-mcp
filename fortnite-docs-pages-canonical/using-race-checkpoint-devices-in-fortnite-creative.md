# Race Checkpoint Devices
The Race Checkpoint device enables designers to make racing games. 
![Race Checkpoint Devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/28cdb783-1148-4de8-9e4e-66b896b903fc?resizing_type=fill&width=1920&height=335)
On this page
You can use the **Race Checkpoint** to place a series of [checkpoints](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#checkpoint) on a map for ground, air, and even foot-race games.
For help on how to find the **Race Checkpoint** device, see [Using Devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-devices-in-fortnite). 
If you're using multiple copies of a device on an island, it can be useful to [rename](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite-creative/rename-a-device) them. Choosing names that relate to a device's purpose makes it easier to remember what each one does, and easier to find a specific device when using the [Event Browser](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/event-browser-in-fortnite-creative). 
##  Contextual Filtering 
Some devices are affected by a feature called contextual filtering. This feature hides or displays options depending on the values selected for certain related options. This feature will reduce clutter in the Customize panel and make options easier to manage and navigate.
However, it may not be easy to recognize which options or values trigger contextual filtering. To help you identify them, in our device docs we use  _italic_ for any values that trigger contextual filtering. All options will be listed, including those affected by contextual filtering; if they are hidden or displayed based on a specific option's value, there will be a note about that in the Description field for that option.
##  Device Options 
This device has some basic functionality, like allowing players to pass through the checkpoint without a vehicle, or allowing specific vehicles to pass.
You will find ways to customize things like checkpoint color and visibility under advanced functionality.
