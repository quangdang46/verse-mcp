![Score Manager Devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/7c9af56e-da45-4584-9c6e-19e3685a198a?resizing_type=fill&width=1920&height=335)
With the **Score Manager** device, creators can manipulate scores using triggers. By using channel messages, the Score Manager can communicate with a variety of devices. Creators can use this to award scores in many ways, creating many varieties of gameplay.
For help on how to find the **Score Manager** device, see [Using Devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-devices-in-fortnite).
If you're using multiple copies of a device on an island, it can be useful to [rename](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#rename-a-device) them. Choosing names that relate to a device's purpose makes it easier to remember what each one does, and easier to find a specific device when using the Event [Browser](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/event-browser-in-fortnite-creative).
##  Contextual Filtering
Some devices are affected by a feature called **contextual filtering**. This feature hides or displays options depending on the values selected for certain related options. This feature will reduce clutter in the Customize panel and make options easier to manage and navigate.
However, it may not be easy to recognize which options or values trigger contextual filtering. To help you identify them, in our device docs we use _italic_ for any values that trigger contextual filtering. All options will be listed, including those affected by contextual filtering; if they are hidden or displayed based on a specific option's value, there will be a note about that in the Description field for that option.
##  Device Options
In its default state, the Score Manager does nothing. It must be activated by receiving a signal from a specific channel.
You can configure this device with the following options.
