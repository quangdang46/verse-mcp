# Bouncer Gallery Devices
You can choose from many types of bouncers that launch players into the air.
![Bouncer Gallery Devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/d59caadc-0ac9-427f-bab2-35ccf03a3165?resizing_type=fill&width=1920&height=335)
A **Bouncer** is a device that launches the player that triggers it into the air.
When a player [triggers](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) the device through contact, they will bounce into the air and can can glide down by pressing the **spacebar**.
The bouncers available in **Fortnite Creative** are in a [gallery](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) of bouncer devices.
The gallery contains the following bouncers:
  * **Classic Bouncer**
  * **Tall Tire Bouncer**
  * **Large Tire Bouncer**
  * **Toppled Tire Bouncer**
  * **Short Tire Bouncer**
  * **Mushroom Bouncer**
  * **Hop Flower**

When you add the gallery to your island, all of the bouncers in the gallery will be added. Delete any bouncers you don't want to use.
To find the Bouncer Gallery, go to the **Creative inventory** and select the **Devices** tab. From there, you can search or browse for the gallery. For more information on finding devices see [Using Devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-devices-in-fortnite).
If you're using multiple copies of a device on an island, it can be helpful to [rename](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) them. Choose names that relate to each device's purpose to make it easier to remember what each one does.
##  Contextual Filtering
Some devices are affected by a feature called **contextual filtering**. This feature hides or displays options depending on the values selected for certain related options. This feature will reduce clutter in the Customize panel and make options easier to manage and navigate.
However, it may not be easy to recognize which options or values trigger contextual filtering. To help you identify them, in our device docs we use _italic_ for any values that trigger contextual filtering. All options will be listed, including those affected by contextual filtering; if they are hidden or displayed based on a specific option’s value, there will be a note about that in the Description field for that option.
##  Device Options
