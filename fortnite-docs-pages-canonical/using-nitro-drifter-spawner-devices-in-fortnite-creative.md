The **Nitro Drifter Spawner** is a fast, stylish car that seats four to encourage social play. The visual look of the vehicle is themed around Cyber-City and fits well with a cyberpunk or Neo-Tokyo aesthetic. This car also has unique handling, with the ability to [drift](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#drift). This works particularly well with racing games, but can add style to any game mode where vehicles are available.
For help on how to find the Nitro Barrel device, see [Using Devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/assets/using-devices-in-fortnite-creative).
If you're using multiple copies of a device on an island, it can be helpful to [rename](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#rename-a-device) them. You can choose names that relate to each device's purpose, so it's easier to remember what each one does.
##  Contextual Filtering
Some devices are affected by a feature called **contextual filtering**. This feature hides or displays options depending on the values selected for certain related options. This feature will reduce clutter in the Customize panel and make options easier to manage and navigate.
However, it may not be easy to recognize which options or values trigger contextual filtering. To help you identify them, in our device docs we use _italic_ for any values that trigger contextual filtering. All options will be listed, including those affected by contextual filtering; if they are hidden or displayed based on a specific option’s value, there will be a note about that in the Description field for that option.
