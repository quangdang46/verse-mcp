![Capture Item Spawner Devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/0f932e9b-2f4c-4e39-9c85-10c58cdfebf5?resizing_type=fill&width=1920&height=335)
The **Capture Item Spawner** is a special type of [item spawner](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) that will only [spawn](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) a single [item](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary).
With this device, you can restrict interaction with that item to a single team, send messages to players based on the state of the item, and transmit signals to other devices based on the state of the item. In this way, you can use an item as an objective.
The Capture Item Spawner holds only one item. Dropping a new item will replace the one currently in the device.
The device has a pulse effect when it is captured or interacted with, and shows current capture percentage on the capture area material. When starting to capture an area, an effect will play on the players that are capturing.
To find the Capture Item Spawner device, go to the Creative inventory and select the Devices tab. From there you can search or browse for the device. For more information on finding devices see [Finding and Placing Devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-devices-in-fortnite).
##  Device Options
In its default state, the Capture Item Spawner has no interaction. You need to [place](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) an item on the device before it can be used.
Once an item has been placed, it will spawn at the start of the game and relay messages to players when the item is picked up, dropped, or captured by a capture area.
###  Contextual Filtering
Some devices are affected by a feature called **contextual filtering**. This feature hides or displays options depending on the values selected for certain related options. This reduces clutter in the Customize panel and makes options easier to manage and navigate. To help identify them, values that trigger contextual filtering are in _italic_.
All options are listed, including those affected by contextual filtering; if they are hidden or displayed based on a specific option's value, there will be a note about it in the Description field for that option.
Default values are **bold**. Values that trigger contextual filtering are _italic_.
