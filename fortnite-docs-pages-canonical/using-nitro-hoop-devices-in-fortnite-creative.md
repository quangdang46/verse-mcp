##  Contextual Filtering
Some devices are affected by a feature called **contextual filtering**. This feature hides or displays options depending on the values selected for certain related options. This reduces clutter in the Customize panel and makes options easier to manage and navigate. To help identify them, values that trigger contextual filtering are in _italic_.
All options are listed, including those affected by contextual filtering; if they are hidden or displayed based on a specific option's value, there will be a note about it in the Description field for that option.
##  Device Options
Default values are **bold**. Values that trigger contextual filtering are _italic_.
You can configure this device with the following options.
Option  |  Value  |  Description
---|---|---
**Base Type** |  **Default** , Halfway, None |  Determines what kind of base the hoop has. **Default** raises the hoop slightly off the ground; **Halfway** is intended for hoops that are partly embedded in the group; **None** means the hoop is level with the ground.
**Add Columns** |  **None** , Pick a number |  This will place the hoop on top of a short column to raise it in the air. If you select a number higher than 1, the columns will be stacked vertically to make a taller column that raises the hoop higher.
**Add Stand** |  True, **False** |  If you select **True** , it places the hoop on a short stand. This raises the hoop up, but less than adding a column does.
**Enable on Phase** |  None, **Always** , Pre-Game Only, Gameplay Only, Create Only |  Determines the phases in which the device is enabled. **Pre-Game Only** includes all phases occurring before the game starts.
**Enable Cooldown** |  True, **False** |  Determines whether automatic cooldown is enabled. If this is set to **True** , using the hoop will cause it to enter cooldown (during which the device is disabled). At the end of the time set in the **Cooldown Duration** option, the hoop will automatically be reenabled.
**Cooldown Duration** |  **10** , Manual End, Pick or enter an amount |  Determines how long the cooldown state lasts, in seconds. If you select **Manual End** , the cooldown state does not automatically end, and you must use event binding to enable the device.
**Cooldown at Game Start** |  On, **Off** |  Determines whether the device goes into the cooldown state as soon as the game starts. If this is set to **On** , the device must be enabled at game start for this to work.
**Cooldown at Round Start** |  On, **Off** |  Determines whether the device goes into the cooldown state as soon as a new round starts (excluding the first round). If this is set to **On** , the device must be enabled when the round starts for this to work.
**Added Player Velocity** |  **45 m/s** , Pick or enter an amount |  If the device is enabled, this determines the amount of velocity (in meters per second) that is added to the player when they pass through the hoop.
**Vehicle Velocity Multiplier** |  **1.125x** , Pick or enter an amount |  If the device is enabled, this determines the velocity multiplier added to vehicles when they pass through the hoop.
