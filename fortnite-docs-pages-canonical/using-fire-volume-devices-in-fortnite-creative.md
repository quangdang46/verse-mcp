The **Fire Volume** device specifies where things can be set on fire. You can use this to limit which objects, terrain, or buildings can be set on fire and which can't. You can also ignite or extinguish fires in this [volume](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) using channels. This device can override [My Island settings](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) to create specific areas where fires are allowed or not allowed.
