Load levels created and saved with the Level Instance device, then move, rotate or stack the levels on top of each other.

Using the **Level Loader** device, you can place levels that you've created and saved with the [Level Instance device](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#level-instance-device). You can place the Level Loader device on or off-grid, rotate it to any angle, and even place it on top of another Level Loader device! This gives you more flexibility when you place your levels on an island.
Here are some examples of how you can use this device:
  * Make modular buildings by creating each modular piece in the Level Instance device and saving it as a level; then use the Level Loader to place and combine different modular pieces into unique structures.
  * Create and save each level of a multi-floor structure with the Level Instance device, then stack them into buildings with the Level Loader.
  * Create a customized gallery of building pieces or props using the Level Instance device, save as a level, then load and use those custom galleries with the Level Loader device.


Any building piece in a level used in a Level Loader device is automatically turned into a [prop](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#prop). This means they do not [snap](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#grid-snap) to the island's [grid](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#grid), and also means that those structures do not support player building pieces.
**Level Loader** device, see [Using Devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-devices-in-fortnite).
If you're using multiple copies of a device on an island, it can be helpful to [rename](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#rename-a-device) them. You can choose names that relate to each device's purpose, so it's easier to remember what each one does.
