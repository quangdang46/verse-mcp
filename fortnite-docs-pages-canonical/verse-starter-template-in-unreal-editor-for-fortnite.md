# Verse Starter Template
Create a minigame where you control a NPC with commands using Verse.
![Verse Starter Template](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/6c2ebc9a-3e98-423b-a684-337941c2a3b6?resizing_type=fill&width=1920&height=335)
Jump into the world of Verse with the **VKT - Verse Device Starter Games** template and play **Verse Commander** , a minigame where you solve puzzles by sending commands to your character.
Minigames are short, self-contained experiences that can act as companion pieces to your main game. They can be as simple as a series of button presses, or as complex as a full game mode. You can use minigames to better pace the gameplay, explore new mechanics and ideas, or just because they're fun! Minigames are often highly scalable, as working from a simple list of mechanics gives you a lot of room to create variety within each game.
This template tutorial walks you through the creation of Verse Commander, a minigame where you guide an NPC character through a series of game boards to reach the end goal. You'll control the NPC using custom Verse commands, directly translating UI choices into character action.
Verse Commander shows how you can use Verse to manage your game, including:
  * Sending data between Verse device and NPC Behavior scripts.
  * Using a custom, dynamic in-game UI created and updated in Verse.
  * Coordinating VFX and cinematics in Verse for visual feedback of the game state.
  * And more!

There's a lot of Verse code in this example, but it's spread over multiple files and classes and designed to be easy to customize and drop into your own experiences. Separating your code into different files based on their responsibilities and designing your code with scalability in mind will not only help you quickly iterate on your core gameplay but also make it easier for you to implement your minigame in multiple experiences.
##  Getting Started
Before you can play the Verse Commander minigame, you'll need to do the following. Create a new project in UEFN from the **VKT - Verse Device Starter Games** template.
  1. In the **Outliner** , search for the device **Verse Commander Minigame** and select the device to open its Details panel.
  2. In its Details panel, select the **VerseTagMarkup** component to view its settings in the Details panel.
  3. Under **Gameplay Tags** , edit the **Tags** property and add the Gameplay Tag **verse_commander_minigame_tag**.
  4. Now launch the session and play the Verse Commander minigame!
