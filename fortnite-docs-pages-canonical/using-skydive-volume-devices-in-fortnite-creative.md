With the **Skydive Volume** , you can create a zone where players are put into a skydive state. You can customize the amount of force used to push the player, and how fast players are launched into the air. The direction of the push is in relation to the device, so you can rotate and overlap several devices, then use variable speeds to create pneumatic tubes that propel players in different directions. You can even create unique traversal (traveling) options, where players can use these zones to reach places on your island they couldn't reach any other way.
For help on how to find the **Skydive Volume** device, see [Using Devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-devices-in-fortnite).
If you're using multiple copies of a device on an island, it can be useful to rename them. Choosing names that relate to a device's purpose makes it easier to remember what each one does, and easier to find a specific device when using the [Event Browser](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/event-browser-in-fortnite-creative).
