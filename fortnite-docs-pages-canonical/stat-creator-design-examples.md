  4. Place a **Stat Counter** device.
  5. Customize the counter:

###  Design Tip
The combination of **Stat Creator** and **Stat Counter** devices is great for creating, changing, and tracking a stat. In this example, it would be easy to add another device and trigger it when the player successfully triggers three explosions.

The **Stat Creator** can be configured to have different levels of a statistic, allowing you to create your own custom gameplay skills! You’ll use this to set up a **parkour skill** stat that gives players an upgrade when they level up!

[![](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/f164bed8-3b6d-4f36-a5b1-610bf5ac6e46?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/f164bed8-3b6d-4f36-a5b1-610bf5ac6e46?resizing_type=fit)

You now have the basic functionality for a parkour skill leveling system!
###  Design Tip
This example only uses one level, but you can easily add levels with other upgrades and rewards!
A skill system like this is a great way to give incentives for players to complete certain tasks a number of times, so get creative with which skills you want to track!
##  Build a Target Level Minigame
The **Stat Creator** can track levels that raise and lower based on different gameplay triggers, allowing for multiple types of stat tracking!
In this example, you’ll create a system that tracks the player’s “wanted level” based on their actions in-game, and spawns enemies to match!

You now have a working target system with the Stat Creator device!
###  Design Tip
This is a classic system that can spruce up all kinds of open world games!
You can also use this with a multiplayer map — maybe the player with the most eliminations has a higher Target Level and gives other players more points for an elimination!
