# Channel Devices
Use this device to simplify the connections between your devices.
![Channel Devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/e66b5c41-8f87-4b9c-8753-84aa44e64907?resizing_type=fill&width=1920&height=335)
The **Channel** device is a simple relay, with only one [event](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) and one [function](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary). It works much like a [Trigger device](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary), but it is easier to connect multiple devices using one Channel device.
When you have complex connections between many devices on your island, using a Channel device instead of multiple Triggers could simplify your setup.
Here are some ways you can use the Channel device:
  * Streamline connections between one group of many devices and another group of many devices.
  * Swap different devices connected to the Channel device to test different game mechanics for your island, or test multiple player actions.
  * Replicate the previous [channel](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) system instead of using [direct event binding](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary).

To find the Channel device, go to the **Creative inventory** and select the **Devices** tab. From there, you can search or browse for the device. For more information on finding devices see [Using Devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-devices-in-fortnite).
If you're using multiple copies of a device on an island, it can be helpful to [rename](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) them. You can choose names that relate to each device's purpose, so it's easier to remember what each one does.
