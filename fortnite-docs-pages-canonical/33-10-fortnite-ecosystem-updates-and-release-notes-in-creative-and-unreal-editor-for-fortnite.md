![33.10 Fortnite Ecosystem Updates and Release Notes](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/aac271ed-2055-4819-a3ed-88617444584b?resizing_type=fill&width=1920&height=335)
Get ready to publish your Fortnite islands using the First Person Camera device. Publishing for these islands unlocks tomorrow! Also with v33.10 you’ll find new options for player communication in your islands with text chat now available and more ways to grow your following with players now able to access Creator Pages in the Fortnite client.
##  Publish Your Islands Using the First Person Camera Device Tomorrow!
It’s almost time! Starting tomorrow, **December 11****at 9 A.M. Eastern Time (ET)** , you can publish your Fortnite islands using the First Person Camera device. We’re excited to see your first-person shooters, tactical games, horror adventures, and everything else you’ve created with this new point of view. [Submit your island](https://create.fortnite.com/welcome)!
Use the First Person Camera device with the new set of Ballistic Weapons special-made for first-person experiences. Read more about the new weapons below.
##  Reminder: Retiring the Old Time of Day Manager and Skydome Device
The Fortnite Creative S14 Time of Day Manager (TODM) and Skydome device are being retired in an upcoming release. This change affects islands using the Skydome device to create custom lighting.
It is recommended to convert all Islands you wish to preserve to the new TODM now. This will give you ample time to adjust the visuals and ensure the conversion is working properly for you.
Converting your island to the new TODM is a **one-way conversion**. Back up your island before upgrading.
##  New Text Chat Experience in Fortnite
**Text chat** has been redesigned and is now available for all Fortnite islands, offering greater flexibility to customize chat settings for your islands.
In addition to voice chat, you can now customize text chat settings for your island’s **Game Channel** , choosing to enable text chat for all players, limit it to teammates only, or disable it entirely. By default, your island’s text chat settings align with your voice chat settings, and you can customize them in the **Island Settings** under **Text Chat**. These new chat options open up exciting opportunities for role playing, and enhance player coordination.
##  New Locomotion Preset Island Setting
The new **Locomotion Preset** setting allows creators to quickly adopt and inherit locomotion from either Battle Royale or Ballistic. Creators will notice other locomotion island settings ([Player Movement] (https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite-creative/player-movement-in-fortnite-creative)) are disabled when using either preset value. This affects the following Player Movement settings:
  * Energy Max
  * Energy Recharge Amount
  * Energy Recharge Delay
  * Fall Damage
  * Fall Damage Type
  * Jump Fatigue
  * Allow Mantling
  * PBWs Generate Ledges
  * Mantling Minimum Height
  * Mantling Minimum Height in Water
  * Allow Hurdling
  * Allow Sprinting
  * Sprinting Energy Cost Per Second
  * Sprinting Jump Multiplier
  * Sprinting Speed Multiplier
  * Allow Sliding
  * Allow Slide Kick
  * Allow Shoulder Bashing
  * Glider Redeploy
  * Player Flight
  * Player Flight Sprint
  * Flight Speed
  * Disable Player Collision
  * Movement Speed Tunings
  * Allow Boosted Jump
  * Allow Roll Landing
  * Allow Wall Kick
  * Allow Wall Scramble

Inherited settings and tuning values will be used, not the values of disabled locomotion island settings. Creators who want finer control of locomotion will use the Custom value, which enables locomotion island settings. Find the new Locomotion Preset settings under Player in the Island Settings.
