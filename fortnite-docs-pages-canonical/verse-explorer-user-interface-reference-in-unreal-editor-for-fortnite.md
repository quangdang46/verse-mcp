![Verse Explorer User Interface Reference](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/4e43f9cf-db97-4a2a-948c-fe97ea7fc196?resizing_type=fill&width=1920&height=335)
**Verse Explorer** is a tool in **Unreal Editor for Fortnite (UEFN)** that creates new [Verse](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/learn-programming-with-verse-in-unreal-editor-for-fortnite) files from templates, organizes your files with [submodules](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/verse-glossary#submodule), and supports renaming and deleting files.
Access Verse Explorer through the **Verse** dropdown menu. You can dock the Explorer tab anywhere in the editor, and next time UEFN opens, the Explorer tab opens in the same place it was last docked.

The key workflow for using Verse Explorer is:
  1. Add a new [Verse file](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/unreal-editor-for-fortnite-glossary#verse-file),
  2. Create a new Verse device from a template, and
  3. Open your Verse file in [Visual Studio Code (VS Code)](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/verse-glossary#visual-studio-code) to modify the device.
