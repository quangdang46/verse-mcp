# Save Point Devices
The Save Point device gives players the ability to save progress, location, resources and stats so they can leave the game and come back without starting over.
![Save Point Devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/b1b59c1c-84e0-4780-903a-0a81ef6a6c44?resizing_type=fill&width=1920&height=335)
The **Save Point** device provides a way for creators to add elimination tracking persistence, inventory and resource tracking across multiple game sessions, and more.
Think of it as saving a snapshot of where the player is at any given time.
For example:
  * In racing games, players can track their best lap times.
  * In adventure games, players can save their progress toward objectives.
  * In skillrun games, players can pick up where they left off instead of having to start over every time they leave the game and come back.

If players are on an island using Save Point devices when a new version of that island is published, those players can continue their session and their progress will be saved. However, if a player matchmakes into an older, non-current version of an island, a HUD message displays stating that the island is not current, their save data will not be loaded, and their save game will not be modified.
To find the Save Point device, see [Finding and Placing Devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-devices-in-fortnite).
##  Contextual Filtering
Some devices are affected by a feature called **contextual filtering**. This feature hides or displays options depending on the values selected for certain related options. This reduces clutter in the Customize panel and makes options easier to manage and navigate. To help identify them, values that trigger contextual filtering are in _italic_.
All options are listed, including those affected by contextual filtering; if they are hidden or displayed based on a specific option's value, there will be a note about it in the Description field for that option.
