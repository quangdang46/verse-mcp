![Customizable Light Devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/c6c6a5de-3972-4739-aa05-9abe78eff969?resizing_type=fill&width=1920&height=335)
The Customizable Light device can be configured in a way that might trigger seizures for people with photosensitive epilepsy.
There are three different kinds of Customizable Lights in Creative:
  * **Customizable Light Device** : This is a light source that can be turned on or off by the player interacting with it, or by signals sent on channels. You can choose a **point light** or a **spotlight**. With this device, there is no associated prop (like a streetlamp or overhead light) that represents the source of the light.
  * **Military Light Gallery** : This gallery is a collection of customizable lights that are integrated with props such as street lights, overhead lamps, and so on.
  * **Customizable Light Gallery** : This gallery contains three customizable lights integrated with props. You can choose a torch, a spotlight, or a row of spotlights. For the row of spotlights, you can only customize one light (the rest of the row duplicates that one light).

The Military Light Gallery and Customizable Light Gallery are both found in the **Galleries** category in the Creative inventory. The **Customizable Light** device is in the **Devices** category in the Content browser. This document only documents the Customizable Light device.
To find the **Customizable Light** device, see [Using Devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-devices-in-fortnite).
If you're using multiple copies of a device on an island, it can be helpful to [rename](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) them. You can choose names that relate to each device's purpose, so it's easier to remember what each one does.
