# Voting Group and Voting Options Devices
Set up a voting system on your island that players can participate in!
![Voting Group and Voting Options Devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/259dc7a8-524f-458f-bb74-66730b073e7b?resizing_type=fill&width=1920&height=335)
Use the **Voting Group** and **Voting Options** devices to create a voting system for players in your game. These two devices work together, and you cannot use them individually. You need one Voting Options device for each available option a player can choose.
Some ways you can use this:
  * Create polls to get direct player feedback.
  * In games where players must identify an infiltrator, set up a vote for players to decide who the spy or traitor is.
  * Create an adversarial game where players periodically vote for who should stay in and who should be eliminated.

For help on how to find the Voting Group and Voting Options devices, see [Using Devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-devices-in-fortnite).
If you're using multiple copies of a device on an island, it can be useful to rename them. Choosing names that relate to a device's purpose makes it easier to remember what each one does, and easier to find a specific device when using the [Event Browser](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/event-browser-in-fortnite-creative).
##  Using the Device
  1. Decide what you want your players to vote on.
  2. Place one **Voting Group** device for each vote you want players to participate in.
  3. Name each Voting Group with a unique name or phrase in the Voting Group option. You can use the same name for that device.
For example, if the vote is for who is on what team, you could use **Vote for Teams** as the Voting Group option value; then rename that Voting Group device with **Vote for Teams**.
  4. Place a Voting Options device for each choice players have in a single vote (a minimum of two), and link the Voting Options devices to their specific Voting Group device.
  5. Use [HUD Message](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-hud-message-devices-in-fortnite-creative) devices or [Billboards](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-billboard-devices-in-fortnite-creative) to give players instructions or more information about the vote.
  6. Use the **Time Limit** option on the Voting Group device to limit the amount of time players have to make their decision and place their vote.
If you are using the **Time Limit** option on the Voting Group device, the vote will end automatically when the time you set has passed. But you can also end the voting period using event binding or Verse.
  7. Alternatively, use other devices to trigger the start of the voting period. Some examples of how you can do this include:
     * Place a **Trigger** device where a player will walk over to start the vote.
     * Define a space with a **Volume** device so that the voting period starts when a player enters that space.
     * Use a **Button** device to give players agency in when to start the vote.
  8. Decide if you want gameplay events occur based on the results of the vote, and set up devices or write Verse code for that if needed.

##  Voting Group Device Options
This section details the Voting Group **device options** (in Creative) or **user options** (in UEFN).
  * To customize options in Creative, approach a device and press **E** to open the **Customize** panel.
  * To customize options in UEFN, select the device in your viewport or in the Outliner. Options for this device are found in the **Details** panel, in the **User Options > Advanced** section.

Default values are **bold**.
You can configure the Voting Group device with the following options.
Option  |  Values  |  Description
---|---|---

**Max Votes Per Player** |  **1** , Pick or enter a number |  Determines the number of times one player can vote. If this is set to a number greater than **1** , a player can vote for multiple options (but cannot switch a vote once cast). If the **Allow Vote Switching** option is set to **On** and this option is set to **1** , a player **can** change their vote after they have cast it.
**Time Limit** |  **0** , Pick or enter an amount |  Sets a time limit for the voting period. The voting period ends when the set amount of time passes. Ending the voting period with event binding or Verse will override this option's value.  Setting the value to **0** means that to end the vote, you must use event binding or Verse to end the voting period.
