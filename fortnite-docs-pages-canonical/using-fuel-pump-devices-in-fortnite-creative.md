A **Fuel Pump** device is a way to provide a fuel source for vehicles. They can also be used to deal considerable damage to players and the environment when destroyed.
These devices can provide infinite amounts of fuel, or have a limited amount of fuel available.
You can set the device to be indestructible during gameplay, or deal damage to a certain team or [class](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) of player. For example:
  * In racing games, players can refuel their cars like drivers do in Nascar or the Grand Prix.
  * For team matches or games that use classes, players can have their own fuel pumps.
  * In [skillrun](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) games, players have to complete a task before they can use the device.


For help on how to find the **Fuel Pump** device, see [Using Devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-devices-in-fortnite).
If you're using multiple copies of a device on an island, it can be helpful to [rename](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) them. You can choose names that relate to each device's purpose, so it's easier to remember what each one does.
##  Contextual Filtering 
Some devices are affected by a feature called **contextual filtering**. This feature hides or displays options depending on the values selected for certain related options. This feature will reduce clutter in the Customize panel and make options easier to manage and navigate.
However it may not be easy to recognize which options or values trigger contextual filtering. To help you identify them, any values that trigger contextual filtering are in _italic_. All options will be listed, including those affected by contextual filtering; if they are hidden or displayed based on a specific option's value, there will be a note about that in the Description field for that option.
##  Device Options 
This device has some basic functionality, like choosing whether to provide players with infinite fuel, or whether the pump can be destroyed by weapons and collisions.
