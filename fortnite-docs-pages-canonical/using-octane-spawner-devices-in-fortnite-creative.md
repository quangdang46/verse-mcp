# Octane Spawner Devices
Boost your gameplay by using Rocket League's Octane vehicles.
![Octane Spawner Devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/30cd12ff-fc06-4a54-b806-ec638a24dad2?resizing_type=fill&width=1920&height=335)
The **Octane Spawner** is a lightweight vehicle made for defying gravity with its rocket boosting, jumping, and aerial maneuverability capabilities. You can even use this vehicle to wall drive, similarly to the [Rocket League](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) gameplay mechanics.
Check out Rocket League's Octane Tutorial to see this device in action by using the island code **7335-2078-5523**.
Like Rocket League, the Octane’s speed is influenced by terrain angles. Driving up a slope will reduce the Octane to subsonic speeds if Boost is not actively applied. Driving down a slope can accelerate the Octane to supersonic speeds.
This vehicle has Sticky Wheels, which allow a player to drive up vertical surfaces. Players will become unstuck from an upside-down surface after a few seconds.
The Octane can also float and use Boost to propel the vehicle across water.
You can place [Rocket Boosts](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/usingrocketboostpowerupdevicesinfortnitecreative) throughout your island to restore the Octane’s Boost.
This vehicle does not use fuel and cannot support passengers.

If you're using multiple copies of a device on an island, it can be helpful to [rename](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#rename-a-device) them. You can choose names that relate to each device's purpose, so it's easier to remember what each one does.
##  Contextual Filtering
Some devices are affected by a feature called contextual filtering. This feature hides or displays options depending on the values selected for specific related options. This feature will reduce clutter in the Customize panel and make options easier to manage and navigate.
However, it may not be easy to recognize which options or values trigger contextual filtering. To help you identify them, in our device docs, we use italics for any values that trigger contextual filtering. All options will be listed, including those affected by contextual filtering; if they are hidden or displayed based on a specific option’s value, there will be a note about that in the Description field for that option.
