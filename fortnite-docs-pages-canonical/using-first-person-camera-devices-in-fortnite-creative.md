The **First Person Camera** device is a camera and controls device you can use to put players into a first-person perspective, so you can create First Person Shooters and other first-person perspective games.
If you're using multiple copies of a device on an island, it can be useful to [rename](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) them. Choosing names that relate to a device's purpose makes it easier to remember what each one does, and easier to find a specific device when using the [Event Browser](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/event-browser-in-fortnite-creative).
##  Finding the Device in Creative
There are multiple ways to search and browse through the **Devices** category to find the First Person Camera.
  * Use the **search bar** to search for a specific device by name. Enter "first person" or "camera" to narrow your search.
  * Explore devices by using **tags**. In the right panel, check the box for any specific keywords you want to use. If you select multiple tags, devices that have any of the selected tags are shown. If you want to get more specific, click **Intersect** above the tag list. This will show only devices that have all the tags you selected.
  * Click the **Sort** button, above the displayed device tiles, to sort the results alphabetically. Clicking this button cycles through the different sorting patterns: Default, A-Z, and Z-A.

##  Camera Terms and Definitions
When developers use a game engine to build a game, they use cameras for lots of different purposes. There are some specialized terms used for these in-game cameras that you might be unfamiliar with. Many of these terms are used in the device options for this and other camera devices. The table below lists these terms and their definitions.
Term  |  Definition
---|---
**Field of View** |  The term **field of view** refers to what the camera can actually "see". The field of view is represented as an angle, and is measured in degrees. Angles have two sides, joined at a point called the vertex.  With cameras, the vertex is the lens (virtual in this case) of the camera. The arms of the angle spread up and down (the vertical axis) from that vertex. The higher the number of degrees, the wider the angle, and the more the camera can see.
**Pitch, Yaw** |  **Pitch** and **yaw** are terms originating in aviation. They refer to the different types of rotation a plane can perform when moving. These terms were adopted into 3D design and game development, to more precisely define a virtual 3D environment and how things are positioned in that virtual space.  Pitch and yaw are measured relative to the object's original position. **Pitch** refers to up and down movement of an object, and **yaw** refers to horizontal left or right movement of an object.  The  _axis of rotation_ is different from the direction of movement. For example, if a plane  _pitches_ , the nose of the plane moves up or down; but the plane is  _rotating_ on the  _Y axis_ (which is the left-right or east-west horizontal axis). See the terms X-axis, Y-axis, and Z-axis in this table.
**Angle Pitch** |  This is a measurement of how much the camera points up or down while framing its target.
**Angle Yaw** |  This is a measurement of how much the camera turns left or right while framing its target.
**Camera Offset** |  Normally the camera view centers on its target. The **camera** **offset** is how far from the center the camera view is. The camera can have an offset amount on the X-, Y-, or Z-axis and it can have an offset on more than one axis at a time.
**X-axis** |  In a 3D space (real or virtual), the X-axis represents horizontal forward/backward (or north/south) movement.
**Y-axis** |  In a 3D space (real or virtual), the Y-axis represents horizontal left/right (or east/west) movement.
**Z-axis** |  In a 3D space (real or virtual), the Z-axis represents vertical up/down movement.
**Transition In Type** |
  * Ease In: The camera transition will start slowly and speed up as it continues.
  * Ease Out: The camera transition will slow down as it ends.
  * Ease In-Out: The camera transition will start slowly, speed up, then slow again as it ends.
  * Linear: The camera transition moves smoothly from one camera to another at the same speed.
  * Fade: The image gradually becomes visible when fading in, or gradually becomes blank when fading out. When Fade is selected an additional fade option become available;  _Fade in Hold Time_.

**Transition Out Type** |
  * **Ease In** : The camera transition will start slowly and speed up as it continues.
  * **Ease Out** : The camera transition will slow down as it ends.
  * **Ease In-Out** : The camera transition will start slowly, speed up, then slow again as it ends.
  * **Linear** : The camera transition moves smoothly from one camera to another at the same speed.
  * **Fade** : The image gradually becomes visible when fading in, or gradually becomes blank when fading out. When Fade is selected an additional fade option become available; _Fade Out Hold Time_.

**Priority System** |  If multiple cameras are assigned to a player, priority determines which camera is active at any point in time.  Priority can be set in the device options. If two cameras are tied for the highest priority, the most recently added camera will become active.
**Boom Collision** |  In film, a boom jib is an apparatus that holds the camera. Boom operators can move and orient the camera with levers and wheels to get the shot they desire.  The Boom Collision properties for fixed angle cameras allow you to determine the behavior of that camera when an object in the scene gets between the camera and its target.
**Deadzone** |  The deadzone refers to an established area within which the target can move around without affecting the camera. When the target moves to an edge of the deadzone, the camera will move to follow the target.
##  Contextual Filtering
Some devices are affected by a feature called **contextual filtering**. This feature hides or displays options depending on the values selected for certain related options. This reduces clutter in the Customize panel and makes options easier to manage and navigate. To help identify them, values that trigger contextual filtering are in _italic_.
All options are listed, including those affected by contextual filtering; if they are hidden or displayed based on a specific option's value, there will be a note about it in the Description field for that option.
##  Device Options
Default values are **bold**. Values that trigger contextual filtering are _italic_.
You can configure this device with the following options.

**Priority** |  **0** , Pick or enter a number |  Determines where this camera falls in the priority system. When multiple cameras are added to a player, the camera with the highest priority is considered the active camera.  Use higher numbers to indicate higher priority. If two cameras are tied for the highest priority, the most recently added will become active.
**Enabled During Phase** |  None, **Always** , Pre-Game Only, Gameplay Only |  Determines which game phase the device is enabled.

**Use as Elimination Camera** |  **No** , Yes, Elimination Only |  Values from this camera will be used to drive the elimination camera.  It will utilize the Field of View, Rotation, and Location Offset, or Location of the Camera.  It will also use the Transition In Time to move the elimination camera from where the camera was upon elimination to its new location and rotation.
