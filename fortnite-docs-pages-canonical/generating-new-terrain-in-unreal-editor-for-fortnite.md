# Generating New Terrain
Customize your terrain by size, location, and more.
![Generating New Terrain](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/3a48ce7f-9374-46a2-8c1d-3a3404629457?resizing_type=fill&width=1920&height=335)
When creating your own terrain, consider what type of landscape works best for the island you want to build. In [Landscape Mode](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/unreal-editor-for-fortnite-glossary#landscape-mode), you can determine the size of the terrain, or even create multiple pieces of terrain using smaller sections.
Select the **Blank** island template from the Project Browser screen.
[![select the Blank island template](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/77edb26b-57eb-4bd8-992b-f6ad2acd936f?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/77edb26b-57eb-4bd8-992b-f6ad2acd936f?resizing_type=fit)
Once the project opens, delete the existing [grid plane](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/unreal-editor-for-fortnite-glossary#grid-plane) by clicking a grid then pressing the **Delete** key. Repeat for any remaining grid planes.
##  Create a Landscape Streaming Proxy
Once you've removed the grid plane, it is replaced by a [Landscape Streaming Proxy](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/unreal-editor-for-fortnite-glossary#landscape-streaming-proxy). This proxy can be edited with the Landscape Mode tools to build a custom landscape, unlike the grid plane, that will only let you place objects on it.
To create a new terrain using Landscape Mode, click the **Select Mode** dropdown menu and select **Landscape Mode**. The **Manage** tools automatically open with **New** selected in the Landscape Mode panel.
[![Select Landscape Mode from the dropdown menu.](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/f47c9030-8533-4bd0-b1f9-186eeb5b65f4?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/f47c9030-8533-4bd0-b1f9-186eeb5b65f4?resizing_type=fit)
The properties inside the **New** tool determine the basic characteristics of the new terrain:
  * Material
  * Location, rotation, and scale
  * Sections, components, and resolution
The section and component properties affect the overall resolution of the terrain. If you are not sure about these settings, change the Overall Resolution property directly.

To create a new terrain from the **New** tool panel, click **Create New** at the top. Use the following dimensions for your landscape area, and click the **Create** button when you're finished.
|  |
---|---|---
**Option** |  **Value** |  **Explanation**
**World Partition Grid Size** |  **9** |  This controls the number of components (functionality added to the Landscape Actor) per landscape streaming proxies per axis. [INCLUDE:#new]
**Section Size** |  **63 x 63** |  This creates a terrain that is larger than the original grid plane in the viewport.
**Sections Per Component** |  **1 x 1** |  This reduces the size of the landscape sections and creates more sections simultaneously.
**Number of Components** |  **8 x 8** |  The number of components in the X and Y axis directions (1-32 for each axis).
**Overall Resolution** |  **505 x 505** |  The **Total Components** are automatically calculated for your terrain based upon the component information you entered above. [INCLUDE:#components]

This creates a flat terrain, and the **Landscape Mode** tools automatically switch to the [Sculpt tools](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/landscape-sculpt-tool-in-unreal-engine) after you click **Create**. These are the tools you’ll use to sculpt mountains, hills, and valleys.
If you want to set up a terrain with the largest possible size, click **Fill World** > **Create** at the bottom of the **New** tool panel. The size limit to Fill World is the equivalent of **2K x 2K**.
