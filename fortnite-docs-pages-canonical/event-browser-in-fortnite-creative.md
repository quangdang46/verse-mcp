See what devices you have on your island, and the functions and events associated with them.
![Event Browser](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/93931808-cd15-46b2-81e1-d4c7f728ecce?resizing_type=fill&width=1920&height=335)
The **Event Browser** is a window that shows devices you've placed on your island, and their relationships with [events](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#event) and [functions](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) based on [direct event binding](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary).
While the Event Browser isn't directly available from the Island Settings tab, it plays an important role in island design, allowing you to review [game mechanics](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#game-mechanics) you've already set up and improve on them.
The Event Browser can also be accessed from any Island Settings category by clicking the **Event Browser** button at the bottom of the screen.
[![Event Browser button at bottom of screen.](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/bbd8a76e-d0ee-4ce6-8f15-5e54129a70df?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/bbd8a76e-d0ee-4ce6-8f15-5e54129a70df?resizing_type=fit) If the buttons at the bottom don't display, click anywhere on the screen to open the button bar.

You can also access the Event Browser from any device **Customize options** window.

##  Using the Event Browser
Accessing the **Event Browser** opens a window that displays a list of all devices in use on your island.
[![Event Browser category.](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/7c08fb09-d85f-4dfb-b4fe-f46c3dfe6436?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/7c08fb09-d85f-4dfb-b4fe-f46c3dfe6436?resizing_type=fit)
This screen lists every device on your island, along with the number of interactions (called **bindings**) for each.
Bindings between devices fall into one of two categories: **outgoing [events]** and **called [functions]**.
A [call](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#call) is an instruction that activates a specific function.
[![The columns that show events and functions.](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/a8d74c14-22a7-4fc0-9091-967641f534fc?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/a8d74c14-22a7-4fc0-9091-967641f534fc?resizing_type=fit)
When you select a device, it shows the number of functions and events associated with the device. It also lists more information about each on the right.
To drill down into more information about a specific device's bindings, highlight it, then click the **Details** button at the bottom of the screen to see more details.
[![The columns that show events and functions.](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/c0482278-f3bf-434b-94aa-699ca062d2a0?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/c0482278-f3bf-434b-94aa-699ca062d2a0?resizing_type=fit)
Press **Esc** to return to the previous screen.
##  Teleporting to a Device
You can teleport directly to any device on your island by highlighting the device, then clicking and holding the **Hold to Teleport** button.
[![Teleport button takes you to the highlighted device.](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/5215c330-98dd-4612-86d7-67734c6a6e1c?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/5215c330-98dd-4612-86d7-67734c6a6e1c?resizing_type=fit)
This can be useful if you want to change any of the bindings (or other device settings).
##  Sorting and Filtering Devices
To sort or filter the results displayed, click **Sort + Filter** , select your criteria, then click **Apply**.
[![Sort or Filter your results](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/0b7d0fc3-7098-408d-8fa8-af3eedc16ff5?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/0b7d0fc3-7098-408d-8fa8-af3eedc16ff5?resizing_type=fit)
When you click **Sort + Filter** , this opens a panel where you can set your viewing criteria.
Sorting and filtering becomes important when you have more devices than will display at one time and want to quickly find specific information.
[![Sort and Filter results](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/04b23441-8a50-4f3e-ad59-92eefeffcdcf?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/04b23441-8a50-4f3e-ad59-92eefeffcdcf?resizing_type=fit)
###  Sorting
Sorting changes the order that devices are listed based on the criteria you select. You can only select one sort method at a time:
  * **Sort alphabetically** (A–Z or Z–A).
  * **Sort by number of bindings** (events or functions) a device has, most to least or least to most.

When you've selected your sort criteria, click **Apply** to save your selection.
###  Filtering
Filtering is how you limit the device display to only those devices you're interested in seeing.
You can only select one filter at a time. **You can, however, combine sorting with filters.**
Filters include:
  * **With events or functions** only shows devices that have bindings applied.
  * **With links** only shows devices that have at least one event or function **linked** to another event or function. .
  * **With functions** shows devices with at least one bound function.
  * **With events** shows devices with at least one bound event.
  * **With functions and no events** shows devices with functions only.
  * **With events and not functions** shows devices with events only.

Any time you change the filter, click **Apply** to save your changes.
To examine the settings on a specific device in Creative, highlight the device in the list, then click and hold the **Hold to Teleport** button.
Pressing **Esc** takes you back to the **Island Settings** tab.
