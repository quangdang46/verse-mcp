# HUD Controller Devices
You can use this device to show or hide parts of the player's HUD.
![HUD Controller Devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/ab5aff2f-f5d6-4376-b3fa-9914d16441cd?resizing_type=fill&width=1920&height=335)
You can use the **HUD Controller** device to show or hide parts of the player's **[HUD](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary)** , or turn off the HUD completely. You can also use this with other devices like the **HUD Message** device, the **Map Indicator** device, and the **Message Feed** device to determine exactly how much information players have during your game, as well as how and when they get that information.
There are several ways you can change what information shows in the HUD: change it in the **User Settings,** use a **Team Settings & Inventory** device, use the **HUD Controller** device, or change it in the [Island Settings](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary). The priority order for changes to the HUD is as follows:
  * **User Settings** (press **Esc** to open the **Game Menu** , then click **Settings**) take priority over the other settings.
  * Team Settings & Inventory device takes priority over the HUD Controller and Island Settings.
  * HUD Controller takes priority over Island Settings.
  * The [Island Settings](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/user-interface-settings-in-fortnite-creative) are lowest in priority. If you want to use the Island ssettings to determine what information is shown in the HUD, make sure that the HUD Controller options are set to **Do Not Override**.

There are two exceptions to the above priority hierarchy:
  * If the Island Settings or any device options are set to make parts of the HUD hidden, a player cannot turn them on in User Settings. This is so all players have access to the same HUD information in the game.
  * If the Island Settings or any device options are set to make parts of the HUD visible, a player can choose to turn them off in User Settings. This gives players the option to turn off parts of the HUD they don't need or want without affecting the experience of other players.

For help on how to find the **HUD Controller** device, see [Using Devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-devices-in-fortnite).
If you're using multiple copies of a device on an island, it can be useful to [rename](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) them. Choosing names that relate to a device's purpose makes it easier to remember what each one does, and easier to find a specific device when using the [Event Browser](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/event-browser-in-fortnite-creative).
##  Contextual Filtering
Some devices are affected by a feature called **contextual filtering**. This feature hides or displays options depending on the values selected for certain related options. This reduces clutter in the Customize panel and makes options easier to manage and navigate. To help identify them, values that trigger contextual filtering are in _italic_.
All options are listed, including those affected by contextual filtering; if they are hidden or displayed based on a specific option's value, there will be a note about it in the Description field for that option.
##  Device Options
This device has some basic functionality, like showing or hiding the [minimap](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary), and showing or hiding player resources.
