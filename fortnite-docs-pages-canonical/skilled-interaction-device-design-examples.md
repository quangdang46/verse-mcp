##  Bind Functions and Events
[Direct event binding](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite-creative/fortnite-creative-glossary#directeventbinding) is how you set devices to communicate directly with other devices. This involves setting [functions](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite-creative/fortnite-creative-glossary#function) and [events](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite-creative/fortnite-creative-glossary#event) for the devices involved.
  1. Configure the following event on the Skilled Interaction device so that a successful interaction lights the fire.
[![](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/42dddbe4-b534-4865-8019-fe453b2163bd?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/42dddbe4-b534-4865-8019-fe453b2163bd?resizing_type=fit)
Event  |  Select Device  |  Select Function  |
---|---|---|---
On Success |  Campfire |  Light |
  2. Configure the following events on the campfire so that entering the zone will trigger the Skilled Interaction device and leaving the zone will extinguish the fire.
[![](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/b33da682-be55-4b0f-85a1-0fc35127e0bb?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/b33da682-be55-4b0f-85a1-0fc35127e0bb?resizing_type=fit)
Event  |  Select Device  |  Select Function
---|---|---
On Entering Area |  Skilled Interaction Device |  Begin Interaction for Instigator
On Leaving Area |  Campfire |  Extingui

You now have the basic functionality for a custom fire-starting interaction!
###  Design Tip
Setting the size of the **Perfect** interaction zone to **0%** makes it so that there is only one successful interaction zone. This is especially good for simple interactions like this one where there’s no difference in outcome between **Good** and **Perfect**.
##  Build a Volcano Escape
You can configure the Skilled Interaction device to require multiple player successes to complete the interaction. When paired with a time limit, this can create a tense and exciting interaction!
