# Changing Terrain with Landscape Mode
Build unique landscapes and terrain for your island using Landscape Mode in Unreal Editor for Fortnite
![Changing Terrain with Landscape Mode](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/5f176ed8-1286-4e31-89e2-ad0adecc7030?resizing_type=fill&width=1920&height=335)
**Landscape Mode** is a set of editing tools in **Unreal Editor for Fortnite (UEFN)** that help you build some or all of the island terrain using the Landscape tools.
This [mode](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/unreal-editor-for-fortnite-glossary#mode) gives you improved control when creating environments. Using Landscape Mode to create your own terrain means your island will look and feel unique to players without taking a lot of time to make.
For more information on Landscape Mode, refer to the [Unreal Engine 5 Landscape Outdoor Terrain documents](https://docs.unrealengine.com/landscape-outdoor-terrain-in-unreal-engine/).
##  How It Works
With the tools in Landscape Mode, you can build custom environments by modifying the terrain of existing islands or create your own terrain from scratch.
There are three stages to working with Landscape:
  1. **Manage:** Create a new Landscape, make it larger or smaller, and manage its properties.
  2. **Sculpt:** Edit the heightmap to shape the terrain.
  3. **Paint:** Edit the weightmaps to blend between different material layers.

To learn more about creating custom landscapes, refer to [**Creating Landscapes**](https://docs.unrealengine.com/creating-landscapes-in-unreal-engine/).
The Visibility Brush causes issues in game for players and vehicles entering caves created with the brush. Players might despawn and vehicles might teleport above the landscape.
##  Manage Tools
**Manage** contains tools for the Landscape as a whole (New, Import) as well as its tiles and/or components (Select, Add, Delete). It also provides controls for managing additional [splines](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/unreal-editor-for-fortnite-glossary#spline) that are associated with the Landscape (Splines).
[![The selection of tools available from Manage.](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/661590cc-6b5a-49b5-914b-633ac311bd1c?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/661590cc-6b5a-49b5-914b-633ac311bd1c?resizing_type=fit)
  * **New:** Create a new Landscape. (See directions below to create a new terrain.)
  * **Import:** Import a Landscape from a file created in a third party application such as Houdini, Gaea, or use real-world satellites data. You can even export the Landscape you’re currently working on to make some changes in another software package and re-import it.
  * **Select:** Select components to change their properties.
  * **Add:** Add components to the Landscape.
  * **Delete:** Delete components from the Landscape.
  * **Splines:** Use **Ctrl + Click** to create splines for roads, pathways or other meshes that need to follow the terrain. [Spline mesh settings](https://docs.unrealengine.com/landscape-splines-in-unreal-engine/) can be found in the **Details** panel when you have segments selected.

You create a new Landscape from scratch from the **Create New** section of the **New** tool panel.
In UEFN the Landscape resolution is limited to a maximum of **2048 by 2048** vertices or an equivalent size, for example, 4096 by 1024 or 8192 by 512.

##  Sculpt Tools
Using the **Sculpt** tools you can change the height of the terrain to create valleys, hills, mountains, and other features. You can utilize different layers to isolate areas or separate broad sculpting changes from finer details. To create a new layer or configure existing layers, right-click in the Edit Layers section.

6 |  Use Clay Brush |  The Clay Brush works by looking at the average direction of all of the faces that are under the mouse and then moving the vertices in the averaged direction. Because of this the Clay Brush is very good at filling in gaps and creating holes in the Landscape. So when you switch to the Clay Brush you reduce the "spiky" appearance of the terrain at the edge of the path and instead sculpt the slope by keeping the slope direction as if adding a layer of clay.

Refer to [**Landscape Sculpt Mode**](https://docs.unrealengine.com/landscape-sculpt-mode-in-unreal-engine/) for more information on sculpting landscapes.
##  Paint Tools
**Paint** weight data to blend between different layers of the assigned Landscape material. Similar to the Sculpt tools, weight data can be created in different edit layers. In addition, the weight data will be painted for the selected material layer. For example, painting weight with the Sand layer selected will paint sand onto the terrain. The order of the material layers determines their visibility meaning that if an upper material layer is painted it might hide a lower material layer.

  * **Paint:** Paints weights within the selected layer. Holding shift while painting removes the weights.
  * **Smooth:** Smooths weights within the selected layer.
  * **Flatten:** Flattens the weights within the selected layer based on the weight of the initial left-click position.
  * **Noise:** Adds noise to the weights within the selected layer to randomly increase or decrease the weights and make it look more natural.

Create more customization with the paint brushes by using the different brush and tool settings in the Landscape panel when **Paint** is selected. Settings available in the Landscape panel depend upon which Paint tool is selected for use. See below for tool settings for:
