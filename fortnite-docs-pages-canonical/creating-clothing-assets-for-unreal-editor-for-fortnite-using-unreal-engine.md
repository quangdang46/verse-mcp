The Unreal Editor for Fortnite supports Unreal Engine's [Chaos Cloth Simulation](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/unreal-engine/cloth-simulation-in-unreal-engine). This system provides accurate and performant cloth simulation for any real-time experience.
You can author your **clothing meshes** on any **Digital Content Creation (DCC) package** and import it to **Unreal Engine** to convert them to **clothing assets**. You can then import these assets into UEFN and use them in-game with the Chaos Cloth component.
As part of the Talisman: MetaHuman template, you can access several downloadable assets including an Unreal Engine project with the MetaHuman wearing Captain Roux's jacket from the Talisman GDC demo. To learn how to access the downloadable files, see the [Talisman MetaHuman Template tutorial](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/talisman-metahuman-template-in-unreal-editor-for-fortnite).

This document will guide you through the process of creating a clothing asset in Unreal Engine and importing it into your UEFN experience.
We will not cover the creation process for the clothing meshes, as they can vary depending on your DCC package of choice.
##  Design your Clothing Meshes
The first step when creating clothing assets is to create your cloth meshes in an external Digital Content Creation (DCC) package, such as Maya, Blender, or Marvelous Designer.
  1. Import your skeletal mesh into your DCC and use it to create the cloth meshes. In the example below, we imported our MetaHuman skeletal mesh into Marvelous Designer to create our clothing meshes.

  2. Once your cloth meshes are ready for export, select the **USD Export** option, and enable the following settings:
     * Mesh
     * Materials
     * Select All Patterns
     * Multiple Objects
     * Thick
     * Unified UV Coordinates
     * Diffuse Map
     * Normal Map
  3. Then click **OK**.

  4. You will see a **Texture** folder as well as a **.usd file** in your target directory. To learn more about creating your asset in Marvelous Designer, take a look at [Making a Sweater with Marvelous Designer](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/making-a-sweater-with-marvelous-designer-in-unreal-editor-for-fortnite).

Now that you have exported your cloth meshes from your DCC package, you will learn how to import them to Unreal Engine and create the cloth assets that will be used in UEFN. Proceed to the [Create your Clothing Asset in Unreal Engine](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/create-your-clothing-asset-in-unreal-engine-in-unreal-editor-for-fortnite) documentation.
