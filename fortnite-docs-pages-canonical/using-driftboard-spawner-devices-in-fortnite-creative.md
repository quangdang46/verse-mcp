![Driftboard Spawner Devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/4369de60-d0cf-4241-acc2-bdf7a36e3b4d?resizing_type=fill&width=1920&height=335)
A **Driftboard Spawner** is a device that [spawns](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) a [Driftboard](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) vehicle at the spawner's location and orientation.
  * Use Driftboard Spawner devices in combination with the [Race Checkpoint Device](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) to design a racing game.
  * Place a player directly on the Driftboard using [event binding](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-driftboard-spawner-devices-in-fortnite-creative).

To find the Driftboard Spawner device, see [Using Devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-devices-in-fortnite).
If you're using multiple copies of a device on an island, it can be helpful to [rename](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) them. Choosing names that relate to a device's purpose makes it easier to remember what each one does, and easier to find a specific device when using the [Event Browser](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/event-browser-in-fortnite-creative).
##  Contextual Filtering
Some devices are affected by a feature called **contextual filtering**. This feature hides or displays options depending on the values selected for certain related options. This reduces clutter in the Customize panel and makes options easier to manage and navigate. To help identify them, values that trigger contextual filtering are in _italic_.
All options are listed, including those affected by contextual filtering; if they are hidden or displayed based on a specific option's value, there will be a note about it in the Description field for that option.
