# Visual Effect Powerup Devices
Use Visual Effect Powerups to create a visual effect when your players do something cool.
![Visual Effect Powerup Devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/d6224be4-b1f5-4d5e-b66b-d54026b5279c?resizing_type=fill&width=1920&height=335)
Use **Visual Effect Powerups** to trigger a visual effect (a glow or an outline) when a player picks something up, or does something noteworthy.
Powerups can be triggered by player interaction, or by binding the effect to another device.
For example, you can set the Visual Effect Powerup to be triggered when a player picks up a Health Powerup, and [grant](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#grant) the player [health](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#health) and a green glow (the effect).
To find the Visual Effect Powerup device, go to the **Creative inventory** and select the **Devices** tab. From there, you can search or browse for the device. For more information on finding devices see [Using Devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-devices-in-fortnite).
If you're using multiple copies of a device on an island, it can be helpful to [rename](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#rename-a-device) them. You can choose names that relate to each device’s purpose, so it’s easier to remember what each one does.
##  Contextual Filtering
Some devices are affected by a feature called **contextual filtering**. This feature hides or displays options depending on the values selected for certain related options. This reduces clutter in the Customize panel and makes options easier to manage and navigate. To help identify them, values that trigger contextual filtering are in _italic_.
All options are listed, including those affected by contextual filtering; if they are hidden or displayed based on a specific option's value, there will be a note about it in the Description field for that option.
