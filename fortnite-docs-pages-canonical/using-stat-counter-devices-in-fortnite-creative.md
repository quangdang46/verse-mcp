![Stat Counter Devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/61a04624-b356-479b-bac4-7075390986f0?resizing_type=fill&width=1920&height=335)
Use the **Stat Counter** device to set statistic (stats) limits that can trigger events when met. This device can set and compare stats for individual players and across teams.
Pair this device with the [Stat Creator](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-stat-creator-devices-in-fortnite-creative) to create games where players can harvest items to gain in-game XP and increase stat levels.
For help on how to find the Stat Counter device, see [Using Devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-devices-in-fortnite).
If you're using multiple copies of a device on an island, it can be helpful to [rename](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#rename-a-device) them. You can choose names that relate to each device’s purpose, so it’s easier to remember what each one does.
##  Contextual Filtering
Some devices are affected by a feature called **contextual filtering**. This feature hides or displays options depending on the values selected for certain related options. This feature will reduce clutter in the Customize panel and make options easier to manage and navigate.
However, it may not be easy to recognize which options or values trigger contextual filtering. To help you identify them, in our device docs, we use _italic_ for any values that trigger contextual filtering. All options will be listed, including those affected by contextual filtering; if they are hidden or displayed based on a specific option’s value, a note about that will be in the Description field for that option.
##  Device Options
This device has some basic functionality, like tracking set statistics. This device can also continuously track and compare the stat value over time.
