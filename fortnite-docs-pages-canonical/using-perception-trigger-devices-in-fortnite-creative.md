# Perception Trigger Devices
Make things happen based on line of sight to players.
![Perception Trigger Devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/162a2f50-fc9e-4fd2-a4f7-c229c6460e0c?resizing_type=fill&width=1920&height=335)
With the **Perception Trigger** , you can drive gameplay using [line of sight](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#line-of-sight) between the device and players. When conditions related to line-of-sight checks are satisfied, the Perception Trigger transmits a signal through a channel to activate other devices.
For help on finding the Orbit Camera device in Creative, see [Using Devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-devices-in-fortnite).
If you're using multiple copies of a device on an island, it can be useful to [rename](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/rename-a-device) them. Choosing names that relate to a device's purpose makes it easier to remember what each one does, and easier to find a specific device when using the [Event Browser](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/event-browser-in-fortnite-creative).
##  Device Options
In its [default](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#default) state, the Perception Trigger does nothing. You must use event binding for this device to be effective. You can configure the device to trigger only for certain classes or teams, to trigger a limited number of times, and you can add a trigger delay and a reset delay. You can also configure the device to display a visual effect or play a sound when triggered.

You now have the basic functionality for a hide and seek game using the Perception Trigger.
This basic functionality could be extended and applied in many different game modes for interesting results. You could create a game where the player needs to reach a certain objective without being spotted. Or consider exploring a competitive multiplayer mode in which players have to battle one another while avoiding being seen by the eye. There are many possibilities, so try to find creative ways to combine different game mechanics in new and unexpected ways.
###  Moving Target
Use the Perception Trigger’s player sightline functionality to change the game based on where the player is looking. In this example, create targets that disappear one second after the player first sees them.

**RandomNumberGenerator** |  Activate |  **PerceptionTrigger1-3** |  On A Player Looks At Device Send Event To |  1 second after the player looks at a Perception Trigger, the Random Number Generator will be activated to choose a new target to enable.
You now have the basic functionality for targets that disappear based on when the player looks at them.
To spruce up the gameplay in this example, explore using Prop Movers to create targets that also move when they are enabled. Explore adding obstacles and barricades to force the player to move around in the area as well.
When using the Perception Trigger, be very aware of how objects are placed on your island. This example would be much less effective if all of the targets were close to one another and the player could see all three at once. Additionally, if the player moves outside of the center of the three targets, the same issue will occur. Be intentional about the level design of your island to ensure that the player can only go where you intend them to.
