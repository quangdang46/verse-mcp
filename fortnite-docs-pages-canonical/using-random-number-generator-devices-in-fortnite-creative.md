# Random Number Generator Devices
Generate a random number and use it to trigger other devices.
![Random Number Generator Devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/4f0d1e72-a0b2-4d1d-a21b-e6343aedb966?resizing_type=fill&width=1920&height=335)
The **Random Number Generator** device randomly rolls a number in the range between two numbers you choose. The result can then be [transmitted](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) to other devices to activate them.
You also have an option to use a [volume](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#volume) to trigger other devices placed within the volume.
For help on how to find the **Random Number Generator (RNG)** device, see [Using Devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-devices-in-fortnite).
If you're using multiple copies of a device on an island, it can be useful to rename them. Choosing names that relate to a device's purpose makes it easier to remember what each one does, and easier to find a specific device when using the [Event Browser](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/event-browser-in-fortnite-creative).
##  Contextual Filtering
Some devices are affected by a feature called contextual filtering. This feature hides or displays options depending on the values selected for certain related options. This feature will reduce clutter in the Customize panel and make options easier to manage and navigate.
However, it may not be easy to recognize which options or values trigger contextual filtering. To help you identify them, in our device docs we use  _italic_ for any values that trigger contextual filtering. All options will be listed, including those affected by contextual filtering; if they are hidden or displayed based on a specific option's value, there will be a note about that in the Description field for that option.
##  Device Options
The device options determine the value limits for the number rolled, the winning value, and other details of the device's appearance and behavior.
In its [default](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#default) state, this device rolls a number from 1 to 6 when the player steps onto it. Its default outcome does nothing, since no signals are transmitted unless options are set.
