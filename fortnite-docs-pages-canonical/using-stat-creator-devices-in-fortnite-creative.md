# Stat Creator Devices
Create sets of custom data to track and query in-game statistics.
![Stat Creator Devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/a7f158f9-ad49-4a3f-a182-248d028e8bd9?resizing_type=fill&width=1920&height=335)
Use the **Stat Creator** device to create custom statistics (stats) with a set value and level to drive your gameplay. These stats are in-game data that can fulfill win/lose conditions and even scoreboard requirements.
With this device, you can create your own in-game XP leveling systems. Pair this device with a [Stat Powerup](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-stat-powerup-devices-in-fortnite-creative) to create a custom stat that continuously decreases in value such as "Heat" to create systems where players must seek shelter or a campfire to replenish.
Within the [Island Settings'](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/understanding-island-settings-in-fortnite-creative) **Mode** tab, you can then navigate to **Victory Condition** > **Round Win Condition** to set your custom status as a win requirement. Navigate to the **Scoreboard Column** options within the **User Interface** tab to set your custom stat within the gameplay's scoreboard.
Through **Unreal Editor for Fortnite** (UEFN), you can even use widget blueprints to further customize your stat's UI.
For help on how to find the Stat Creator device, see [**Using Devices**](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-devices-in-fortnite-creative).
If you're using multiple copies of a device on an island, it can be helpful to [rename](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#rename-a-device) them. You can choose names that relate to each device’s purpose, so it’s easier to remember what each one does.
##  Contextual Filtering
Some devices are affected by a feature called **contextual filtering**. This feature hides or displays options depending on the values selected for certain related options. This feature will reduce clutter in the Customize panel and make options easier to manage and navigate.
However, it may not be easy to recognize which options or values trigger contextual filtering. To help you identify them, in our device docs we use _italic_ for any values that trigger contextual filtering. All options will be listed, including those affected by contextual filtering; if they are hidden or displayed based on a specific option’s value, there will be a note about that in the Description field for that option.
##  Device Options
This device has some basic functionality, such as setting the value's parameters and determining who the stat will apply to. Additionally, there are some advanced options like broadcasting events for all players and using persistence.
You can configure this device with the following options.
Default values are **bold**. Values that trigger contextual filtering are _italic_.
