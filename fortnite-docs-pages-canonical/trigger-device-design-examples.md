######  Prerequisite topics
In order to understand and use the content on this page, make sure you are familiar with the following topics:
  * [Trigger Devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-trigger-devices-in-fortnite-creative)

**Trigger** devices are useful for triggering other devices, and can be activated by players, vehicles, or other devices.
##  Make an Automatic Door
When you combine a **Trigger** device with a **Lock** device, you have an easy way to set up a door that automatically opens and closes.
###  Devices Used
  * 2 x Trigger devices
  * 1 x [Player Spawner](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-player-spawn-pad-devices-in-fortnite-creative) device
  * 1 x [Lock ](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-lock-devices-in-fortnite-creative)device

###  Set Up the Devices
  1. Place the **Art Deco Bank** prefab.
  2. Place a **Player Spawner** device in front of the front door.
  3. Place a **Lock** device on the door panel. Make sure the light on the lock is blue — this indicates that it is successfully connected to the door.
  4. Place a **Trigger** device in front of the door, and change the size to make sure it is wide enough to cover the entire ground in front of the double doors.
  5. Customize the trigger so that it isn't visible in the game.

  6. Place a second Trigger device away from the building. This trigger will close the door again after it is opened.
  7. Customize the second trigger.

---|---
Option |  Value
Visible In Game |  Off
Triggered by Player |  Off
Trigger Delay |  2.0 Seconds
Trigger VFX |  Off
Trigger SFX |  Off
  8. Configure the following **event** on the first trigger so that it opens the door and triggers the closing trigger when the player steps on it.
[![](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/9e814725-f4d7-4196-a25d-46c881f3f780?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/9e814725-f4d7-4196-a25d-46c881f3f780?resizing_type=fit)
|  |
---|---|---
Event |  Select Device |  Select Function
On Triggered |  Lock Device |  Open
On Triggered |  Close Trigger |  Trigger
  9. Configure the following event on the closing trigger so that it closes the door after a delay.
[![](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/82960535-18c0-4bbc-97be-78b6bd8c1b36?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/82960535-18c0-4bbc-97be-78b6bd8c1b36?resizing_type=fit)
|  |
---|---|---
Event |  Select Device |  Select Function
On Triggered |  Lock Device |  Close

You now have the basic functionality for an automatic door!
###  Design Tip
This simple functionality can be extended in many ways. If you want players to open the door from either side, place another trigger on the inside of the door and configure it the same way as the first.
You can also connect other devices to a trigger. For example, you could set an alarm to go off if a player goes somewhere they shouldn't!
##  Random Loadout
Triggers can be activated by sequencers like the **Random Number Generator** device. Combining a trigger with a random number generator provides a way to grant a player a random loadout!
###  Devices Used
  * 4 x Trigger devices
  * 1 x Player Spawner device
  * 1 x [Random Number Generator](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-random-number-generator-devices-in-fortnite-creative) device
  * 4 x [Item Granter](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-item-granter-devices-in-fortnite-creative) devices
  * 1 x [Button ](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-button-devices-in-fortnite-creative)device

###  Set Up the Devices
  1. Place a **Player Spawner** device.
  2. Place a **Random Number Generator** device.
  3. Customize the device.

  6. Place an **Item Granter** device next to the random number generator. Register a **Combat Shotgun** to the device
  7. Configure the following event on the trigger so that it triggers the item granter to grant the player the Combat Shotgun when triggered.
[![](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/035a9eaa-4fe3-40f6-8b40-c917fc61d2e7?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/035a9eaa-4fe3-40f6-8b40-c917fc61d2e7?resizing_type=fit)
|  |
---|---|---
Event |  Select Device |  Select Function
On Triggered |  Item Granter 1 |  Grant Item
  8. Duplicate the **Trigger** and **Item Granter** devices three more times, placing each in each of the sequencer zones of the random number generator. **Copy both devices at the same time to preserve the events bound between them.**
  9. Update the three new item granters to have a **Combat Assault Rifle** , **Combat SMG** , and **Bolt Action Sniper Rifle** registered respectively.
  10. Place a **Button** device and customize.

  11. Configure the following event on the **Button** device so that it starts the **Random Number Generator** device and gives the player a new loadout when activated.
[![](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/ff65712e-af71-45eb-b26b-90fcd6ae76c2?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/ff65712e-af71-45eb-b26b-90fcd6ae76c2?resizing_type=fit)
|  |
---|---|---
Event |  Select Device |  Select Function
On Interact |  Random Number Generator |  Activate

You now have the basic functionality for a random loadout system!
###  Design Tip
Another way to trigger the system is to configure the Random Number Generator device to activate at the start of the game, giving each player a random starting weapon.
Think about how you could set up the system as an unlockable upgrade in which the player can re-roll their loadout!
##  Build a Surfboard Time Trial
The Trigger device can be activated by objects other than players, such as projectiles, creatures, and vehicles. In this example, you’ll use triggers to create a speed course for a surfboard. Yes, a surfboard!

###  Design Tip
The **Race Checkpoint** devices can produce a similar effect to this mechanic, but they are more specialized for races in which the player must go through checkpoints in a specific order.
For this example, a custom trigger used with another trigger that tracks progress through a checkpoint works better.
