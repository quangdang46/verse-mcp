# Overlord Spire Devices
Use the Overlord Spire to create large boss-like encounters that really challenge your players!
![Overlord Spire Devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/39937db5-3b23-48fd-a0d2-84961cbc01f4?resizing_type=fill&width=1920&height=335)
The Overlord Spire device is a large, environment-based encounter that can provide a boss-like challenge for your players. It is summoned from the sky, crashes down to the ground, and is activated when players approach.
The Overlord Spire has many large and powerful special attacks you can choose from, such as:
  * A sweeping beam attack that moves in an arc.
  * A projectile attack, with missiles that home in on players.
  * A powerful slam attack, which causes immediate damage and initiates a shockwave that does additional damage.

Additionally, the Overlord Spire has a scream attack, which can spawn additional enemies, activate turrets, or cause other hazards. You can do this using event binding to trigger other devices.
For help on how to find the **Overlord Spire** device, see [Using Devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-devices-in-fortnite).
If you're using multiple copies of a device on an island, it can be useful to [rename](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#rename-a-device) them. Choosing names that relate to a device's purpose makes it easier to remember what each one does, and easier to find a specific device when using the [Event Browser](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/event-browser-in-fortnite-creative).
##  Contextual Filtering in Creative
In Creative, some devices are affected by a feature called **contextual filtering**. This feature hides or displays options depending on the values selected for certain related options. This reduces clutter in the Customize panel and makes options easier to manage and navigate. To help identify them, values that trigger contextual filtering are in _italic_.
All options are listed, including those affected by contextual filtering; if they are hidden or displayed based on a specific option's value, there will be a note about it in the Description field for that option.
##  Device Options
This section details the **device options** (in Creative) or **user options** (in UEFN).
  * To customize options in Creative, approach a device and press **E** to open the **Customize** panel.
  * To customize options in UEFN, select the device in your viewport or in the Outliner. Options for this device are found in the **Details** panel, in the **User Options** section.

Default values are **bold**. Values that trigger contextual filtering are _italic_.
You can configure this device with the following options.

##  Event Binding
Following are the functions and events for this device.
  * In Creative, the functions and events are customized in the **Customize** panel (like other device options).
  * In UEFN, you can find them in the **Details** panel under **User Options - Functions** and **User Options - Events**.

While you can set both functions and events in Creative (or in a Live Edit session in UEFN), you can only set functions in UEFN, and **events are read-only**.
