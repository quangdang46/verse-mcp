The **Fixed Point Camera** device can be used to override the default Fortnite camera, giving you the freedom to create entirely new types of gameplay and new [game genres](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary). Place the Fixed Point Camera in a specific location where you want the player's view to focus on a specific object, character, or area. You can use the device options to specify if the camera stays still, or if it can rotate up and down or turn left and right, in order to keep a target in-frame.
You will need to use a [Third Person Controls](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-third-person-controls-devices-in-fortnite-creative) device with this camera. To learn more about how to use the camera and controls devices together, see [Designing with Cameras and Controls](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/designing-with-cameras-and-controls-in-fortnite-creative).

##  Camera Terms and Definitions
When developers use a game engine to build a game, they use cameras for lots of different purposes. There are some specialized terms used for these in-game cameras that you might be unfamiliar with. Many of these terms are used in the device options for this and other camera devices. The table below lists these terms and their definitions.
Term  |  Definition
---|---
**Field of View** |  The term **field of view** (or **FOV** for short) refers to what the camera can actually "see". The field of view is represented as an angle, and is measured in degrees. Angles have two sides, joined at a point called the **vertex**. With cameras, the vertex is the lens (virtual in this case) of the camera. The arms of the angle spread up and down (the vertical axis) from that vertex. The higher the number of degrees, the wider the angle, and the more the camera can see.
**Pitch, Yaw** |  **Pitch** and **yaw** are terms originating in aviation. They refer to the different types of rotation a plane can perform when moving. These terms were adopted into 3D design and game development to more precisely define a virtual 3D environment and how things are positioned in that virtual space. Pitch and yaw are measured relative to the object's original position. **Pitch** refers to up and down movement of an object, and **yaw** refers to horizontal left or right movement of an object. **Note** : the **axis of rotation** is different from the direction of movement. For example, if a plane **pitches** , the nose of the plane moves up or down; but the plane is **rotating** on the Y-axis (which is the left-right or east-west horizontal axis). See the terms **X-axis** , **Y-axis** , and **Z-axis** in this table.
**Angle Pitch** |  This is a measurement of how much the camera points up or down while framing its target.
**Angle Yaw** |  This is a measurement of how much the camera turns left or right while framing its target.
**Camera Offset** |  Normally the camera view centers on its target. The **camera offset** is how far from the center the camera view is. The camera can have an offset amount on the X-, Y-, or Z-axis and it can have an offset on more than one axis at a time.
**X-axis** |  In a 3D space (real or virtual), the X-axis represents horizontal forward/backward (or north/south) movement.
**Y-axis** |  In a 3D space (real or virtual), the Y-axis represents horizontal left/right (or east/west) movement.
**Z-axis** |  In a 3D space (real or virtual), the Z-axis represents vertical up/down movement.
**Camera Transition** |  When you have multiple cameras active, a **transition** is when you move from one camera view to another. In Fortnite, camera devices have an **In Priority** and an **Out Priority**. The camera transition is determined by the highest priority, comparing the Out Priority of the current camera with the In Priority of the destination camera.
**Transition Types** |  **Ease In** : the camera transition will start slowly and speed up as it continues. **Ease Out** : the camera transition will slow down as it ends. **Ease In-Out** : the camera transition will start slowly, speed up, then slow again as it ends. **Linear** : the camera transition moves smoothly from one camera to another at the same speed. **Fade** : the camera will fade in from black and fade out to black.
**Priority System** |  If multiple cameras are assigned to a player, priority determines which camera is active at any point in time. Priority can be set in the device options. If two cameras are tied for the highest priority, the most recently added camera will become active.
**Boom Collision** |  In film, a boom jib is an apparatus that holds the camera. Boom operators can move and orient the camera with levers and wheels to get the shot they desire. The Boom Collision properties for fixed angle cameras allow you to determine the behavior of that camera when an object in the scene gets between the camera and its target.
**Deadzone** |  The **deadzone** refers to an established area within which the target can move around without affecting the camera. When the target moves to an edge of the deadzone, the camera will move to follow the target.
##  Contextual Filtering
Some devices are affected by a feature called **contextual filtering**. This feature hides or displays options depending on the values selected for certain related options. This feature will reduce clutter in the Customize panel and make options easier to manage and navigate.
However, it may not be easy to recognize which options or values trigger contextual filtering. To help you identify them, in our device docs we use _italic_ for any values that trigger contextual filtering. All options will be listed, including those affected by contextual filtering; if they are hidden or displayed based on a specific option’s value, there will be a note about that in the Description field for that option.
##  Device Options
Configure this device with the following options.
Default values are **bold**. Values that trigger contextual filtering are _italic_.
Option  |  Value  |  Description
---|---|---
**Priority** |  **0** , Pick or enter a number |  Determines where this camera falls in the priority system. When multiple cameras are added to a player, the camera with the highest priority is considered the active camera.

**Remove on Elimination** |  On, **Off** |  Determines whether this camera is removed from a player when they are eliminated.
**Add to Players on Start** |  **On** , Off |  Determines whether this camera is automatically added to all players when the game starts.
**Use as Elimination Camera** |  **No** , Yes, Elimination Only |  Values from this camera are used to drive the elimination camera. It uses the Field of View, Rotation, and Location Offset or Location of the camera.  It also uses the Transition in time to move the elimination camera from where the camera was upon elimination to its new location and rotation.
**Field of View** |  **80** , Pick or enter a number of degrees from 20-120 |  This option only displays if the **Projection Mode** option is set to **Perspective**.  The term **field of view** refers to what the camera can actually see. This setting determines the angle on the vertical axis, in degrees, that represents the Field of View for this camera.  A higher number makes a wider angle, which results in a larger field of view.
**Camera Shake** |  On, **Off** |  If this is set to **On** , the camera will support screen shake events in the game.
**Focus Target Override** |  **None** , Select a target |  This option only becomes available when **Look at Target** is set to **On**. Override object for the camera's focus target. Does nothing if set to None.
