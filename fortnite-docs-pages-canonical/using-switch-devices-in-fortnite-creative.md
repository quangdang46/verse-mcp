# Switch Devices
Use this switch on devices players can turn on or off, or for other interactions.
![Switch Devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/fe44a35a-7793-449c-bfe2-7b3488ea2140?resizing_type=fill&width=1920&height=335)
There are two ways you can use a **Switch**.
  * As a physical switch that players can interact with, used with other devices so that players can open and close doors or turn lights off and on. If the Switch is made invisible, you can also use it to add interactivity to a prop!
  * As a method for filtering interactions with other devices. For example, if the state of the Switch is **On** , it send an event, and if the Switch is **Off** , it will send a different event.

To find the Switch device, see [Using Devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-devices-in-fortnite).
##  Contextual Filtering
Some devices are affected by a feature called **contextual filtering**. This feature hides or displays options depending on the values selected for certain related options. This feature will reduce clutter in the Customize panel and make options easier to manage and navigate.
However, it may not be easy to recognize which options or values trigger contextual filtering. To help you identify them, any values that trigger contextual filtering are in _italic_. All options will be listed, including those affected by contextual filtering; if they are hidden or displayed based on a specific option's value, there will be a note about that in the Description field for that option.
##  Device Options
This device has some basic functionality, like setting switch visibility, and choosing what text the player sees when they interact with the switch. Additionally, there are some advanced options that you can use if the switch is able to save its state.
You can configure this device with the following options.
Default values are **bold**. Values that use contextual filtering are in _italics_.
Option  |  Value  |  Description
---|---|---
**Enabled at Game Start** |  **Yes** , No |  Determines whether the device is [enabled](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) when the game starts. Disabled devices ignore all events except Enable.
**Initial State** |  **Off** , On |  This is the default starting state of the switch when there is no player-sourced state to override it.
**Visible During Game** |  **Yes** , No |  Determines whether the device is visible to players during the game.
**Turn On Text** |  Enter text into field |  Sets the text that displays when turning the Switch to the On position. The text field has a 150 character limit.

**Times Can Change** |  **1** , Pick or enter a number |  Determines the number of times the device can be toggled before it is disabled.
**Infinite Cooldown** |  **_No_** , Yes |  Determines the cooldown time between interactions with the device. If you set this to **Yes** , the **Cooldown Time** option does not display below this one.
**Cooldown Time** |  **Instant** , Pick an amount of seconds |  This option only displays when the **Infinite Cooldown** option is set to **No**. Determines the cooldown time between interactions.
**Allowed Class** |  No Class, **Any** , Pick or enter a class |  Determines which class can activate the device.
**Allowed Team** |  **Any** , Pick or enter a team |  Determines which team can activate the device.
**Interaction Radius** |  **0** , Pick or enter a radius distance |  Allows players to interact by looking at any point within a radius of the specified size, rather than having to look directly at the button. Use in conjunction with the **Visibility** setting to make it appear as though players are interacting with other props.
**State Reset Time** |  **No Reset** , Pick or enter an amount of time |  Determines the amount of time before the device resets to its default state.
**Mutually Exclusive** |  **No Exclusivity** , Pick a number |  Turning this switch to **On** will turn off any other switches that have the same Mutually Exclusive index number.
**Store State Per Player** |  Yes, **No** |  If this is set to **Yes** , each player will have their own switch state. If this is set to **No** , all players have the same switch state. If this is set to **No** and the **Use Persistence** option is set to **Use** , the switch will use the **Resolve Conflicts** option when the state attempts to load.
**Use Persistence** |  **Do Not Use** , _Use_ |  Whether or not this device should load any data from the backend. If you choose **Use** , additional options are displayed in the All Options tab.
**Auto-Save** |  Yes, **No** |  This option only displays if the **Use Persistence** option is set to **Use**. Determines whether the switch state is automatically saved when it changes.
**Auto-Load** |  On, **Off** |  This option only displays if the **Use Persistence** option is set to **Use**. Determines whether the switch state is automatically loaded at Game Start, or if it must be loaded using event binding.
**Resolve Conflicts** |  First Player, **Majority** , Prioritize On, Prioritize Off |  This option only displays if the **Use Persistence** option is set to **Use**. Determines what happens when the state is loaded and the **Store State Per Player** option is set to **No**. Values for this option:
  * **First Player** : The switch loads the state of the oldest active player.
  * **Majority** : The switch loads the state that is the most prevalent, with ties using the **Initial State** option's value.
  * **Prioritize On** : The switch loads the **On** state if at least one player has that state.
  * **Prioritize Off** : The switch loades the **Off** state if at least one player has that state.

**Check State at Game Start** |  **Enabled** , Disabled |  Determines if the switch will check its state at Game Start, triggering the **On Check Result On** or **On Check Result Off** events.
**Check Switch State When Disabled** |  Yes, **No** |  Determines whether the device will check its state even when it is disabled.
##  Direct Event Binding
Direct event binding allows devices to communicate directly, which makes your workflow more intuitive, and gives you more freedom to focus on your design ideas.
Below are the following direct event binding options for this device.
###  Functions
A [function](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) listens for an event on a device then performs an action.
  1. For any function, click the **option** , then **Select Device** to access and select from the **Device dropdown menu**.
  2. Once you've selected a device, click **Select Event** to bind the device to an event that will trigger the function for the device.
  3. If more than one device or event triggers a function, press the **Add** button to add a line and repeat these steps.
