**Santa's Toy Factory Template** - Developed by The LEGO® Group, the UEFN template is a factory-style game demo providing new tutorials, Verse code, gameplay examples, and assets that LEGO Island creators can use to explore adding persistence and offline progression mechanics to their own LEGO Islands — encouraging return visits from players.

##  Chapter 5 Time of Day Manager (TODM) in Creative
The new TODM provides:
  * More realistic lighting with Lumen and Nanite.
  * Parity with the UEFN TODM.
  * No more siloed development for UEFN lighting.

What the TODM conversion affects:
  * Custom lighting set with a Skydome device

It is recommended to opt in early to update your old islands to the Chapter 5 TODM lighting. All islands will automatically transfer to the new TODM system in an upcoming release, and the Skydome device will be retired. Any islands using the Skydome device will no longer have custom lighting set with the device.
To create custom lighting, use the [Day Sequence device](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/uefn/using-day-sequence-devices-in-unreal-editor-for-fortnite) as well as the [**Ambience settings**](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite-creative/world-settings-in-fortnite-creative#ambiencesettings) available in World Settings.
##  Unreal Revision Control (URC) Status Highlighting
We've released a feature to highlight actors in the viewport based on their URC status, so you can see what parts of your project are in various states.
By default, actors **checked out by others** and actors that are **out of date** will be highlighted. You can also turn on highlights for actors **checked out by you** or for **newly added** actors that haven't been checked in yet. To control which statuses are highlighted, and with what opacity, click **Show > Revision Control**.
We've also improved the Outliner's functionality to enable you to filter by revision control status!
##  First Person Camera Mode Device Enters Beta Soon!
The First Person Camera Mode device is entering Beta on December 11, meaning you'll soon be able to publish islands using this device! Starting December 11, head to the [Creator Portal](https://create.fortnite.com/welcome) to submit your island for content review.
Please remember that all content created using the First Person Camera Mode device should follow the [Fortnite Island Creator rules](https://www.fortnite.com/news/fortnite-island-creator-rules) and align with Fortnite's age rating.
##  Device Updates
**Orbit Camera** : the new **Clamp Horizontal Mode** option determines the basis for locking horizontal rotation when the camera is attached to the player.
Values include:
  * **Player Relative** : Default. This keeps the camera's horizontal rotation clamped in a range based on where the player was looking when they spawned.
  * **Device Relative** : This clamps the horizontal rotation of the camera based on the direction the device is facing.
  * **World Relative** : This clamps the horizontal rotation of the camera based on the World's 0.0 coordinates.

##  Galleries Updates
The **Megalodon Prefabs and Galleries** are now available in Fortnite Creative:
  * Shipyard Wall Gallery
  * Shipyard Floor & Stairs Gallery
  * Shipyard Roof Gallery
  * Shipyard Prop Gallery
  * Megalodon Ship Wall Gallery
  * Megalodon Ship Prop Gallery
  * Megalodon Ship Prefab
  * Restored Reels Nature Gallery
  * Underworld Nature Gallery
