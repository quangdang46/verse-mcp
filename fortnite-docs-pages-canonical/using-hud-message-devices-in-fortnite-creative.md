# HUD Message Devices
Create custom HUD messages for players based on time or activities.
![HUD Message Devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/9d5f0a2e-276f-4361-9804-320f6244c62f?resizing_type=fill&width=1920&height=335)
The **HUD Message** device displays messages to all players or specific ones, either through a trigger from another device or through a timer from the start of a [round](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary).
If you're using multiple copies of a device on an island, it can be helpful to [rename](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) them. Choosing names that relate to a device's purpose makes it easier to remember what each one does, and easier to find a specific device when using the [Event Browser](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/event-browser-in-fortnite-creative).
##  Contextual Filtering
Some devices are affected by a feature called contextual filtering. This feature hides or displays options depending on the values selected for certain related options. This feature will reduce clutter in the Customize panel and make options easier to manage and navigate.
However, it may not be easy to recognize which options or values trigger contextual filtering. To help you identify them, in our device docs we use _italic_ for any values that trigger contextual filtering. All options will be listed, including those affected by contextual filtering; if they are hidden or displayed based on a specific option's value, there will be a note about that in the **Description** field for that option.
##  Device Options
You can configure this device with the following options.
Default values are **bold**. Values that trigger contextual filtering are _italic_.
Option  |  Value  |  Description
---|---|---
**Message** |  Enter text and format text |  Click the **Format Styles** tab to choose a style for your text. A list of styles available is on the right. Each individual word must be clicked to select, then clicked again to de-select it. When you want to apply a style, click every word you want to have that style. If you want some words to have one style, and other words to have a different style, make sure you de-select previously selected words before selecting new words for the next style.
