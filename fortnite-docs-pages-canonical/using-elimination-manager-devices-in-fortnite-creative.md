# Elimination Manager Devices
Place items in this device and the items will drop when a player or other target is eliminated.
![Elimination Manager Devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/443dde34-c9e4-42d5-a76b-99b5a407bd99?resizing_type=fill&width=1920&height=335)
You can drop items on the **Elimination Manager** device to [register](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) the items. When a player eliminates a certain target, items registered with the **Elimination Manager** will spawn at the eliminated target's location. You can also set the device to drop items in a specific order, or to drop them randomly, or have the items drop when a player is eliminated, or when other enemies, such as fiends or sentries, are eliminated.

If you're using multiple copies of a device on an island, it can be useful to [rename](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) them. Choosing names that relate to a device's purpose makes it easier to remember what each one does, and easier to find a specific device when using the [Event Browser](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/event-browser-in-fortnite-creative).
##  Contextual Filtering
Some devices are affected by a feature called **contextual filtering**. This feature hides or displays options depending on the values selected for certain related options. This feature will reduce clutter in the Customize panel and make options easier to manage and navigate.
However, it may not be easy to recognize which options or values trigger contextual filtering. To help you identify them, in our device docs we use _italic_ for any values that trigger contextual filtering. All options will be listed, including those affected by contextual filtering; if they are hidden or displayed based on a specific option’s value, there will be a note about that in the Description field for that option.
##  Device Options
By default, the Elimination Manager does nothing. Once an item has been placed into it during [Create mode](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary), the Elimination Manager becomes active and will drop that item at the location of any player that is eliminated during the game.
This device has some basic functionality, like determining how many items drop when a player is eliminated. Additionally, there are some advanced options, like choosing which target drops items when eliminated, or changing the drop rate to a percentage so items only drop sometimes.
Default values are **bold**. Values that trigger contextual filtering are _italic_.
