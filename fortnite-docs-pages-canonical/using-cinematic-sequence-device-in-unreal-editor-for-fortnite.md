# Cinematic Sequence Device
Add a unique cinematic sequence to your island to drive the game plot and engage players visually.
![Cinematic Sequence Device](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/158bd1fc-8234-4bd8-ba99-0c386b9485fe?resizing_type=fill&width=1920&height=335)
The **Cinematic Sequence** device provides a way to add [cinematic sequences](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/unreal-editor-for-fortnite-glossary#cinematic-sequence) to levels, allowing you to add custom [keyframe](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/unreal-editor-for-fortnite-glossary#keyframe) animation on a non-linear timeline.
Think of it as creating a cutscene to showcase an enemy's capabilities, an important cinematic that shows how to perform a task, or an exchange between characters to drive the story.
For more informaiton on how to use the device with a level sequence, see [Sequencer and Control Rig](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/uefn/sequencer-and-control-rig-in-unreal-editor-for-fortnite).
This device uses a lot of [memory](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/memory-used-bar) and requires a lot of computing power to add animations. Loading one Cinematic Sequence device on your island will take a few seconds, so use caution when adding multiples of this device on the same island.
The amount of memory the device takes is largely dependent on the complexity of the asset it plays. Playtest your sequences to make sure they run smoothly in Fortnite Creative.
##  Finding and Placing the Device
  1. Open the **[Content Browser](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/unreal-editor-for-fortnite-glossary#content-browser)**.
  2. Open the **Fortnite** folder index list.
  3. Open the **Devices** folder.
  4. Select the **Cinematic Sequence** device and click-and-drag the device into the **viewport**.
  5. Select the **Cinematic Sequence** device in the **Outliner** panel.

If you're using multiple copies of a device on an island, it can be helpful to [rename](https://www.fortnite.com/en-US/creative/docs/fortnite-creative-glossary#rename-a-device) them. You can choose [names](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/outliner-tips-and-tricks-in-unreal-editor-for-fortnite) that relate to each device’s purpose, so it’s easier to remember what each one does.
##  User Options
This device plays a pre-authored [Level Sequence](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/level-sequence-settings-in-the-unreal-engine-project-settings?application_version=5.5) when triggered by another device. Drag the device into the **viewport** where you can change the device’s scale, [axis](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/unreal-editor-for-fortnite-glossary#axis) (X, Y, and Z), and rotation. Pull the device by its Z-axis to make the base visible and to make it sit on the level plane.
