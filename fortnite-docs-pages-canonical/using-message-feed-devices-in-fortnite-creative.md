The **Message Feed** device gives you the ability to send a short message to the player's message feed. In an [elimination confirmed](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#elimination-confirmed) [game mode](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#game-mode), this could be used to broadcast when eliminations are confirmed or when points are granted. For other game modes, such as [capture the flag](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#capture-the-flag) or [domination](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#domination), the feed could include messages about flags captured or returned, areas that change teams, or other events in a game. In fast-paced game modes, this device gives you the ability to provide players with an on-screen stream of information about rapidly changing conditions.

If you're using multiple copies of a device on an island, it can be helpful to [rename](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#rename-a-device) them. You can choose names that relate to each device's purpose, so it's easier to remember what each one does.
