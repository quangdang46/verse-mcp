A long corridor lies ahead of our adventurer, cloaked in near darkness. As she moves forward, the door opens, and torches to the sides burst into life. A ticking sound indicates that she only has a short window before the door closes. She hurries forward, but not fast enough, just as she reaches the door it slams shut and the torches go out. Better try again…

##  Ingredients
**You will need:**
  * **1 Trigger device**
  * **1 Timer device**
  * **1 Lock device**
  * **2 Customizable Light devices (Burning Torches)**

##  Method
Create a corridor with a door at the end. Embed a Lock Device into the wall with the door. The Lock can control the door, so it stays locked unless the Timer is running. Place the Trigger at the start of the corridor to open the door, switch on the torches, and start the timer. Set the Timer anywhere, and give the player just enough time to get through the door. When the Timer completes, it sends a signal to close the door, switch off the torches, and resets itself.
##  Modified Options
###  Trigger Device Options
Modified Options - Trigger  |
---|---
Visible in Game |  No
We don't want the player to know that they'll be touching the trigger, so set the **Visible In Game** option to **No** so that the Trigger is hidden from players.
###  Timer Device Options
Modified Options - Timer  |
---|---
Duration |  3 Seconds
Auto Start |  Off
Alarm Audio |  Off
Set the **Duration** to be just enough to get through the door in time. Set the **Auto Start** option to **Off** (the Trigger will be activating it) and set the **Alarm Audio** option to **Off**.
###  Customizable Light Device Options
Modified Options - Customizable Light (both)  |
---|---
Initial State |  Off
Turn On Team Filter |  None
Turn Off Team Filter |  None
Initially, we want the Burning Torches to be switched off, so set their **Initial State** to **Off**. Also, switch both their **Team Filters** to **None** to keep players from interacting with the torches directly.
###  Lock Device Options
Modified Options - Lock Device  |
---|---
Visible In Game |  Off
Set the **Visible In Game** option for the Lock to **Off** , as it doesn't fit particularly well with our medieval theme.
