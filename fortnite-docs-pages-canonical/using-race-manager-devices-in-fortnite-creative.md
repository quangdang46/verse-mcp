When used with the [Race Checkpoint device](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-race-checkpoint-devices-in-fortnite-creative), **Race Manager** provides a way for designers to create more advanced racing modes, including the following race management features.
  * Tracks and displays the number of complete laps (or checkpoints)
  * Tracks and displays lap and race times, including the record time

For help on how to find the **Race Manager** device, see [Using Devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-devices-in-fortnite).
If you're using multiple copies of a device on an island, it can be useful to rename them. Choosing names that relate to a device's purpose makes it easier to remember what each one does, and easier to find a specific device when using the [Event Browser](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/event-browser-in-fortnite-creative).
##  Contextual Filtering
Some devices are affected by a feature called contextual filtering. This feature hides or displays options depending on the values selected for certain related options. This feature will reduce clutter in the Customize panel and make options easier to manage and navigate.
However, it may not be easy to recognize which options or values trigger contextual filtering. To help you identify them, in our device docs we use  _italic_ for any values that trigger contextual filtering. All options will be listed, including those affected by contextual filtering; if they are hidden or displayed based on a specific option's value, there will be a note about that in the Description field for that option.
##  Device Options
This device has some basic functionality, such as setting up the number of laps. Advanced functionality gives developers ways to customize display checkpoint markers, customize navigation arrows, and more.
You can configure this device with the following options.
Default values are **bold**. Values that trigger contextual filtering are _italic_.
