![Helicopter Spawner Devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/1e6eb05a-726e-4d61-b45c-eb9488428943?resizing_type=fill&width=1920&height=335)
A **Helicopter Spawner** is a device that [spawns](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#spawning) a Helicopter vehicle into the level at the spawner's given location and orientation.
  * Use Helicopter Spawner devices in combination with the [Race Checkpoint Device](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#race-checkpoint) to design a racing game for your players.
  * You can place a player directly inside the Helicopter using a trigger.

For help finding the Helicopter Spawner device, see [Using Devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-devices-in-fortnite).
It’s helpful to [customize device names](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#rename-a-device) when you use multiple copies of the same device.
##  Contextual Filtering
Some devices are affected by a feature called contextual filtering. This feature hides or displays options depending on the values selected for certain related options. This feature will reduce clutter in the Customize panel and make options easier to manage and navigate.
However, it may not be easy to recognize which options or values trigger contextual filtering. To help you identify them, in our device docs we use italic for any values that trigger contextual filtering. All options will be listed, including those affected by contextual filtering; if they are hidden or displayed based on a specific option’s value, there will be a note about that in the Description field for that option.
##  Device Options
This device has some basic functionality, like whether it is visible in game, or whether it supports [wraps](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#wrap). Additionally, there are some advanced options, like which [class](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#class) and team can use the vehicle, and whether [enabling](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#enable) or disabling the device spawns or [despawns](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#despawn) the vehicle.
