Content for levels now downloads before matchmaking, allowing players to load into creative islands much faster! Creator Portal now shows Accolades and Analytics device activation data to all team members. Have fun discovering LEGO® Spring content and the updated Assembly device. Seaport Prefabs and Galleries are here, along with new weapons and items! Don’t forget to check out the latest Verse code snippets to bring more functionality to your islands. Level up your knowledge with the Mission Selection Screen tutorial and brand new device design examples!
##  Content Downloads Pre-Matchmaking
Before matchmaking starts, all players in the lobby will download the content needed to play an Unreal Editor for Fortnite experience. Previously, this download would happen once the player connected to the server — but now it happens before matchmaking. This will help players load into the island faster for those with slower internet connections or for players on mobile devices.
Matchmaking will not start until all party members have downloaded the required content to play. This improves the experience for large islands because players won't be joining as late, and players won't be left in the lobby while their party members travel to the game.
##  Creator Portal Metrics Updates
Accolades and Analytics device activation data is now available in the Creator Portal through your Project Analytics tab. This allows all team members with access to analytics to view device data regardless of who placed the devices.
##  Brand Island Updates
###  LEGO® Updates
####  Project Spring
Spring is here! With the new LEGO Spring Content, you can add festive flora and fun to your LEGO island. These galleries consist of 47 spring-festival themed props — think trees, flower stalls, picnic tables, benches, and more.

    * Spring Playground
  * Two new galleries:
    * Spring Celebration Prop Gallery

##  New Verse Code Snippets
Check out the latest Verse snippets added to the [Snippets Repository](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/fortnite/snippets)! Snippets are ready-made, copy-pastable code blocks that you can bring into your existing projects to add custom functionality.
[**Heaps and Heapsort:**](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/snippets/Gw1G/fortnite-heaps-and-heapsort) A parametric type implementation of priority queues using Min-Heaps, including Heapsort, an application of priority queues for sorting arrays. Common applications of priority queues include pathfinding algorithms on graph structures such as Dijkstra's algorithm or A* pathfinding algorithm.
[**Matrices:**](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/snippets/bO9r/fortnite-matrices) A Verse library containing an implementation of float matrices, including: matrix addition and multiplication, transposition, inversion, determinants, and solving systems of linear equations.
[**Graphs:**](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/snippets/2WVO/fortnite-graphs) A Verse library implementation of integer and float edge-weighted graphs, including methods for generating random graphs and an implementation of Dijkstra's path algorithm that uses both the Graphs and Heaps libraries. You can use edge-weighted graphs to represent distances or costs of traveling between objects in your game. Dijkstra's algorithm finds the shortest or lowest cost path between any two objects.

**Fixes:**

  * Fixed an issue where some weapons were not damaging the Bank Vault after it had been destroyed and reset.
  * Fixed an issue where NPCs stopped emoting when the player swapped emotes or jams.

##  UEFN Updates and Fixes
**New:**
  * Added a Search functionality to the metrics tree view for the Spatial Profiler.
  * Added a change that allows the maximum number of AI NPCs displayed to the client to match the maximum number of AI NPCs allowed to be spawned in a session. This value is now 90 for both at the time of this release.
  * As you animate, you can now hold down the Shift key to keep sockets in the same absolute location when reparenting.
  * Improved the Texture Validation tooltip warning that displays when a texture's LOD Bias needs updating. Removed unnecessary Texture Validation warnings related to missing asset tags.
  * Character Definitions will now generate a thumbnail matching the selected skin of that character in most cases.
  * UMG widget assets are now generated in the Verse digest. It's possible to add and remove them on-screen using `player_ui AddWidget/RemoveWidget`.
  * Thumbnails can now be generated on existing character definitions by swapping the character type, saving it, swapping it back, and then resaving it.

**Fixes:**
  * Pushing changes for a map material no longer crashes the game.

  * Fixed a crash that occurred when accepting the Duplicate tool on a volume.

##  Scene Graph Update
The Scene Graph Verse path has been updated. Instead of `/UnrealEngine.com/Temporary/SceneGraph` you should now be using `/Verse.org/SceneGraph`.
##  Verse Updates and Fixes
###  API Updates
**New:**
  * Change `(Verse.org/SpatialMath:)GetYawPitchRollDegrees` to return a `tuple(float, float, float)` instead of a `[]float`.

**Fix:**
  * Fixed an issue where volume devices were not working with Verse tag queries.

###  Tools Update
**New:**
